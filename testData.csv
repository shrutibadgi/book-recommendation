 the book tells the story in flashbacks during the actual mars mission of the chronicalized history until the mission s beginning  the point of divergence for this alternate timeline happens on november 22  1963  where john f  kennedy survived the assassination  jacqueline kennedy was killed  in the renaming of the kennedy space center as the jacqueline b  kennedy space center   but was crippled and thus incapacitated  as lyndon b  johnson is still sworn in  on july 20  1969  astronauts neil armstrong and joe muldoon walk on the moon  and nixon s  most historic phone call  is joined by a call from former president kennedy  committing the united states to send a manned mission to mars  which nixon backs as part of his fateful decision to decide the future of manned spaceflight  instead of deciding on the space shuttle program as he did in our timeline  preparations for this new goal include slashing the number of moon landings so funding and leftover apollo spacecraft hardware can go towards the efforts of the manned mars mission  apollo 12 still lands  apollo 13 still suffers its disaster  but apollo 14 is crewed by the astronauts of the canceled apollo 15 mission in order to carry out the scientific experiments on the lunar surface  and is the last manned moon landing  at the same time  the nerva program is revived to become the chosen mars spacecraft development  with larger tests in nevada  but without containment and plagued with engineering problems  the book centers around chronicling the lives of the future mars mission astronauts  nasa and contractor personnel all involved helping in making the mission become a reality  and the shifts within nasa s astronaut and management hierarchy throughout the mission s preparations  including female geologist natalie york s quest to become an astronaut  and her stormy relationships between fellow astronaut ben priest and with nerva engineer mike conlig  other astronauts include ralph gershon  a former fighter bomber pilot involved in illegal bombing missions in cambodia during the vietnam war whose dream is to be the first black man in space  and phil stone  a veteran air force test pilot turned astronaut who has flown in a long term stay on a lunar orbital station before the mars mission  in the 1970s  the skylab space station is launched  but apparently as a wet workshop design that is based on the saturn ib s ivb upper stage called skylab a  the saturn v that might have launched skylab in our timeline instead launches skylab b  a lunar orbit space station unofficially named  moonlab   also a wet workshop based on the s ivb  the apollo soyuz test project is instead a series of visits by the apollo command service module to salyut space stations  and soyuz missions to both skylab and moonlab  to facilitate the latter  the soviets finally finish work on their n 1  the skylab moonlab programs lead to improvements in the design of the apollo command service module  a block iii csm is produced using battery power in place of fuel cells  followed by the block iv and v  which had a degree of reusability  modular construction and resistance to salt water corrosion   also chronicled is the development of the experimental  mars excursion module  by small aerospace firm columbia aviation as it struggles against larger rival contractors of nasa and its engineers working painstakingly against the technical challenges of a working and reliable mars lander  during the reagan administration  the saturn v is upgraded to the saturn vb  which has numerous improvements  including the use of solid rocket boosters to double its payload  a test of the nerva is finally launched atop one of these  called apollo n  but suffers from pogo oscillations in the s ic first stage  this damages the nerva upper stage  which catastrophically fails once fired in orbit    despite returning to earth safely  the entire crew  including ben priest  is killed from radiation poisoning  and the space program nearly collapses from hostile political and public opinion against the use of nuclear power in space  and the seemingly unnecessary risks and reasons of a mars mission  in the aftermath  a new mars mission plan dubbed ares is drawn up  utilizing on orbit assembly of a different long duration mars ship using wet workshop saturn rocket components as the propulsion systems as well as a skylab habitat module and external tanks to hold extra fuel  and performing a venus flyby reminiscent of the manned venus flyby nasa planned in the aftermath of the original apollo program  but done in this timeline for gravitational assistance  and finally a landing at mangala valles on march 27  1986  however  as a side effect  a number of unmanned probes   including the viking program  pioneer venus project  mariner 10  pioneers 10 and 11  and the voyager program   are cancelled so that their funding can be redirected to the manned mars mission  although another mariner orbiter is sent to mars to help prepare for the manned landing  as a result  although humans walk on mars  their knowledge of the solar system  including mars itself  is far less than in reality ,fantasy

now 65 year old  begins by saying that it may be agreeable to his son to know some of the incidents of his father s life    so with a week s uninterrupted leisure  he is beginning to write them down for william  he starts with some anecdotes of his grandfather  uncles  father and mother  he deals with his childhood  his fondness for reading  and his service as an apprentice to his brother james

anonymous paper and slips it under the door of the printing house by night  not knowing its author  james and his friends praise the paper and it is published in the courant  which encourages ben to produce more essays  the  silence dogood  essays  which are also published  when ben reveals his authorship  james is angered  thinking the recognition of his papers will make ben too vain  james and ben have frequent disputes and ben seeks for a way to escape from working under james  eventually james gets in trouble with the colonial assembly  which jails him for a short time and then forbids him to continue publishing his paper  james and his friends come up with the stratagem that the courant should hereafter be published under the name of benjamin franklin  although james will still actually be in control  james signs a discharge of ben s apprenticeship papers but writes up new private indenture papers for ben to sign which will secure ben s service for the remainder of the agreed time  but when a fresh disagreement arises between the brothers  ben chooses to leave james  correctly judging that james will not dare to produce the secret indenture papers    it was not fair in me to take this advantage   franklin comments   and this i therefore reckon one of the first errata of my life    james does  however  make it impossible for ben to get work anywhere else in boston  sneaking onto a ship without his father s or brother s knowledge  ben heads for new york  but the printer william bradford is unable to employ him    however  he tells ben that his son andrew  a philadelphia printer  may be able to use him since one of his son s principal employees had just died  by the time ben reaches philadelphia  andrew bradford has already replaced his employee  but refers ben to samuel keimer  another printer in the city  who is able to give him work  the governor  sir william keith  takes notice of franklin and offers to set him up in business for himself  on keith s recommendation  franklin goes to london for printing supplies  but when he arrives  he finds that keith has not written the promised letter of recommendation for him  and that  no one who knew him had the smallest dependence on him   franklin finds work in london until an opportunity arises of returning to philadelphia as an assistant to thomas denham  a quaker merchant    but when denham takes ill and dies  he returns to manage keimer s shop  keimer soon comes to feel that franklin s wages are too high and provokes a quarrel which causes the latter to quit  at this point a fellow employee  hugh meredith  suggests that franklin and he set up a partnership to start a printing shop of their own    this is subsidized by funds from meredith s father  though most of the work is done by franklin as meredith is not much of a press worker and is given to drinking  they establish their business  and plan to start a newspaper  but when keimer hears of this plan  he rushes out a paper of his own  the pennsylvania gazette  this publication limps along for three quarters of a year before franklin buys the paper from keimer and makes it  extremely profitable    the saturday evening post traces its lineage to franklin s pennsylvania gazette   the partnership also receives an appointment as printer for the pennsylvania assembly  when hugh meredith s father experiences financial setbacks and cannot continue backing the partnership  two friends separately offer to lend franklin the money he needs to stay in business    the partnership amicably dissolves as meredith goes to

ordinary gentlemen http    www ushistory org franklin philadelphia aps htm he draws up proposals for a  subscription library   the first public library  at this point part one breaks off  with a memo in franklin s writing noting that  the affairs of the revolution occasion d the interruption   the second part begins with two letters franklin received in the early 1780s while in paris  encouraging him to continue the autobiography  of which both correspondents have read part one   although franklin does not say so  there had been a breach with his son william after the writing of part one  since the father had sided with the revolutionaries and the son had remained loyal to the british crown   at passy  a suburb of paris  franklin begins part two in 1784  giving a more detailed account of his public library plan  he then discusses his  bold and arduous project of arriving at moral perfection   listing thirteen virtues he wishes to perfect in himself  he creates a book with columns for each day of the week  in which he marks with black spots his offenses against each virtue of these virtues  he notices that order is the hardest for him to keep  he eventually realizes that perfection is not to be attained  but feels himself better and happier because of his attempt  beginning in august 1788 when franklin had returned to philadelphia  the author says he will not be able to utilize his papers as much as he had expected  since many were lost in the recent revolutionary war  he has  however  found and quotes a couple of his writings from the 1730s that survived  one is the  substance of an intended creed  consisting of what he then considered to be the  essentials  of all religions  he had intended this as a basis for a projected sect but  franklin says  did not pursue the project  in 1732  franklin first publishes his poor richard s almanac  which becomes very successful  he also continues his profitable newspaper  in 1734  a preacher named rev  samuel hemphill arrives from county tyrone ireland    franklin supports him and writes pamphlets on his behalf  however  someone finds out that hemphill has been plagiarizing portions of his sermons from others  although franklin rationalizes this by saying he would rather hear good sermons taken from others than poor sermons of the man s own composition  franklin studies languages  reconciles with his brother james  and loses a four year old son to smallpox  franklin s club  the junto  grows and breaks up into subordinate clubs  franklin becomes clerk of the general assembly in 1736  and the following year becomes comptroller to the postmaster general  which makes it easier to get reports and fulfill subscriptions for his newspaper  he proposes improvements to the city  watch and fire prevention regulations  the famed preacher george whitefield arrives in 1739  and despite significant differences in their religious beliefs  franklin assists whitefield by printing his sermons and journals and lodging him in his house  as franklin continues to succeed  he provides the capital for several of his workers to start printing houses of their own in other colonies  he makes further proposals for the public good  including some for the defense of pennsylvania  which cause him to contend with the pacifist position of the quakers  in 1740 he invents the franklin stove  refusing a patent on the device because it was for  the good of the people   he proposes an academy  which opens after money is raised by subscription for it and it expands so much that a new building has to be constructed for it  franklin obtains other governmental positions  city councilman  alderman  burgess  justice of the peace  and helps negotiate a treaty with the indians  after helping dr  thomas bond establish a hospital  he helps pave the streets of philadelphia and draws up a proposal for dr  john fothergill about doing the same in london  in 1753 franklin becomes deputy postmaster general  the next year  as war with the french is expected  representatives of the several colonies  including franklin  meet with the indians to discuss defense    franklin at this time draws up a proposal for the union of the colonies  but it is not adopted  general braddock arrives with two regiments  and franklin helps him secure wagons and horses  but the general refuses to take ben s warning about danger from hostile indians during braddock s planned march to frontenac  now kingston  ontario   when braddock s troops are subsequently attacked  the general is mortally wounded and his forces abandon their supplies and flee  a militia is formed on the basis of a proposal by benjamin franklin  and the governor asks him to take command of the northwestern frontier  with his son as aide de camp  franklin heads for gnadenhut  raising men for the militia and building forts  returning to philadelphia  he is chosen colonel of the regiment    his officers honor him by personally escorting him out of town  this attention offends the proprietor of the colony  thomas penn  son of william penn  when someone writes an account of it in a letter to him  whereupon the proprietor complains to the government in england about franklin  now the autobiography discusses  the rise and progress of  franklin s  philosophical reputation   he starts experiments with electricity and writes letters about them that are published in england as a book  franklin s description of his experiments is translated into french  and abb   nollet  who is offended because this work calls into question his own theory of electricity  publishes his own book of letters attacking franklin  declining to respond on the grounds that anyone could duplicate and thus verify his experiments  franklin sees another french author refute nollet  and as franklin s book is translated into other languages  its views are gradually accepted and nollet s are discarded  franklin is also voted an honorary member of the royal society  a new governor arrives  but disputes between the assembly and the governor continue   since the colonial governors are bound to fulfill the instructions issued by the colony s proprietor  there is a continuing struggle for power between the legislature and the governor and proprietor   the assembly is on the verge of sending franklin to england to petition the king against the governor and proprietor  but meanwhile lord loudoun arrives on behalf of the english government to mediate the differences  franklin nevertheless goes to england accompanied by his son  after stopping at new york and making an unsuccessful attempt to be recompensed by loudoun for his outlay of funds during his militia service  they arrive in england on july 27  1757  written sometime between november 1789 and franklin s death on april 17  1790  this section is very brief  after franklin and his son arrive in london  the former is counselled by dr  fothergill on the best way to advocate his cause on behalf of the colonies  franklin visits lord granville  president of the king s privy council  who asserts that the king is the legislator of the colonies  franklin then meets the proprietaries  the switch to the plural is franklin s  so apparently others besides thomas penn are involved   but the respective sides are far from any kind of agreement  the proprietaries ask franklin to write a summary of the colonists  complaints    when he does so  their solicitor for reasons of personal enmity delays a response  over a year later  the proprietaries finally respond to the assembly  regarding the summary to be a  flimsy justification of their conduct   during this delay the assembly has prevailed on the governor to pass a taxation act  and franklin defends the act in english court so that it can receive royal assent  while the assembly thanks franklin  the proprietaries  enraged at the governor  turn him out and threaten legal action against him    in the last sentence  franklin tells us the governor  despis d the threats  and they were never put in execution   it is apparent that franklin intended to cover more ground  because an outline of the autobiography written by him and copied by henry ends with a reference to the treaty of paris  which franklin helped negotiate  so the obvious inference is that franklin s death prevented his proceeding further with the autobiography ,autobiography

caer dallben  in haste after getting news from kaw the crow that princess eilonwy has returned from the isle of mona  indeed they find her at home  along with her escort king rhun of mona and the former giant glew who had been magically restored to human size by potion from dallben  taran knows himself now and he is determined to propose marriage to eilonwy  before he gets to it  the bard king fflewddur fflam and his mount llyan arrive with a gravely injured gwydion  prince of don  servants of arawn had ambushed them and seized the magical black sword dyrnwyn  fortunately their purpose was to secure it and depart  how did taran escape  fflewddur asks  evidently arawn himself came from annuvin to the verge of caer dallben in the guise of taran  with no more than the powers of taran  in order to snare them  because dyrnwyn may be pivotal as a threat to arawn  dallben consults the oracular pig hen wen to determine how it may be regained  during the reading  the ash rods used to communicate shatter and the two thirds of hen wen s answer are discouraging and vague  when gwydion heals sufficiently  he sets out with taran and others to meet with king smoit  gwydion insists that he alone should enter annuvin to seek the sword  but smoit s cantrev cadiffor is on the way  the small party divides for rhun and eilonwy to visit the ships of mona en route  when gwydion  taran  and others reach caer cadarn  they are imprisoned by magg  former chief steward of mona and traitor  he and a small force have previously imprisoned king smoit and imprisoned or deceived his men  when eilonwy approaches with the other party  she detects something amiss and they cautiously send fflewddur fflam to the gate as a bard traveling alone  after entertaining soldiers for a night  he returns with the bad news  gwystyl of the fair folk is also outside the stronghold  en route home after closing the waypost near annuvin  personally bearing his final observations to king eiddileg  eilonwy takes him by surprise and he reluctantly reveals the voluminous fair folks stores concealed in his cloak  with his personal assistance  and stocked with magical smokes  fires  and concealments  all but king rhun  with their mounts  break in and free the prisoners  the plan goes awry  however    king smoit and his men are finally able to regain control only by rhun s intervention  which costs his life  learning from gwystyl that the huntsmen and cauldron born of annuvin are active outside that realm  gwydion turns from the quest for dyrnwyn to planning for battle  presumably first at caer dathyl  gwystyl  fflewddur  and taran leave separately to support from the fair folk  the northern realms  fflewddur s small kingdom is northeast   and the free commots where taran wandered the last couple years  southeast   meanwhile  unknown to gwydion  the pet crow kaw has been attacked by gwythaints while spying near annuvin  chased far east  he manages to reach medwyn and that guardian of animals has raised the alarm  asking all the creatures of air and land to oppose the forces of arawn  taran  coll  eilonwy and gurgi travel under the unfinished banner of the white pig on a green field  designed and embroidered by eilonwy  taran musters the commots  and sends them marching in groups to caer dathyl while the smiths and weavers rallied by hevydd and dwyvach work day and night to equip them  they people rally  to the banner of the white pig because     it is the banner of our friend taran wanderer   ch 9  soon after taran and the last commots reach caer dathyl  king pryderi arrives from the western realms  northwest   in council he announces his new allegiance to arawn  for the good of all  because  arawn will do what the sons of don have failed to do   make an end of endless wars among the cantrevs  and bring peace where there was none before   ch 11  he is rejected utterly but permitted to return unharmed to his command of the greatest army  battle begins next day  although the sons of don and allies have the best of it  the cauldron born arrive en masse before evening  bearing a great ram  the attack parts for their remorseless march to the gates  which they finally burst and then raze the fortress overnight  high king math and most inside defenders are killed  and gwydion is proclaimed high king in camp  the cauldron born have never before left annuvin in numbers  gwydion determines that the best chance is to attack while it is guarded by mortal men alone  he will lead the sons of don to waiting ships on the north coast  and attack by sea  while taran leads the commots to delay the cauldron born return march  their power wanes with time and distance from annuvin   there is no time to wait for other allies to arrive  taran and his army reinforce a broken wall and  man  it with branches    they are able to hold the tired cauldron born warriors beyond arm s length by brute force  and turn the march from a straight and easy route into the rugged hills  thanks to a company of fair folk  and to the wolves and bears  they destroy most of the huntsmen who accompany and lead the undead  at last the cauldron born break free of the hills and return to the lowland route  however  regaining strength as they near annuvin  it would be futile for the exhausted allies to meet them again head on  inevitably they will march the long  easy route to arawn s stronghold  taran and the remainder of his army finally reach annuvin by the direct route  led by doli into the mountains and by achren almost over the peak of mount dragon  taran sees that victory is nearly in gwydion s hands  already in the courtyards of the stronghold  but the march of the cauldron born looks to be just in time to smash the attackers  and a few of the undead break ranks to march up and meet him  at the last  after hurling stone upon the warriors  and tipping the great  dragon  rock off the very summit to roll down  he finds the sword dyrnwyn uncovered there  he draws the blade  whose flame dismays even the only the undead warrior to reach him  with it he slays the one  and all of his brethren die as well  crying out for the first and only time  after the chaotic defeat of arawn s forces  the companions gather before the great hall  achren identifies arawn in the form of a serpent near to striking taran  and grabs him    he strikes her fatally  but cannot strike again before taran cleaves him with dyrnwyn  then the sword begins to fade  losing its magic  the stronghold bursts in flame and falls in ruins  eilonwy and chief bard taliesin are able to read the old inscription on the scabbard    draw dyrnwyn  only thou of noble worth  to rule with justice  to strike down evil  who wields it in good cause shall slay even the lord of death   the allies travel to caer dallben by ship  gwydion tells that in victory the sons of don  with all kinsmen and kinswomen  must return to the summer country  indeed  all those who still have magic will depart   all enchantments shall pass away   the fair folk have shut down surface wayposts and closed their realm  dallben and eilonwy with personal powers must go  and others who have served well have the option  taran among them  he proposes to eilonwy at last  and she accepts of course  they will embark again tomorrow  overnight  taran is uncomfortable about his decision  the witches orddu  orwen and orgoch appear as beautiful young women and reveal that they too are departing  and leaving him with the unfinished tapestry of his life  he realizes there is much work to be done to rebuild prydain  and he has made many promises  so he determines to remain behind  eilonwy is able to give up her magical nature magically  in order to remain with him  and the two are married  dallben reveals that taran completes a path prophesied in the book of three whereby an orphan of  no station in life  would succeed the sons of don as high king  eventually  dallben traveled to seek such a one and try to hasten the day    he found a baby hidden in the trees beside a battlefield of great carnage  without any token of parentage  taran receives many gifts including the book of three itself  although  it no longer foretells what is to come  only what has been   in it dallben writes a conclusion   and thus did an assistant pig keeper become high king of prydain   in time  only the bards knew the truth of it ,childrens literaturee

giant back to their colony  where he is revived and reveals himself to be called lonna bowstripe  he is told that his attacker was most likely the pirate raga bol  whose ship has been lost  and his crew of sea rats  who are moving inland  lonna vows to hunt down and kill the entire crew  armed with his bow and arrows  he sets out to exact his revenge  meanwhile at redwall abbey  there is a young hare maid named martha braebuck  who is totally incapable of walking  thus restricting her to a wheelchair  she is wheeled around by her hyperactive brother hortwill braebuck  horty  and his friends  springald and fenna  while napping in front of the tapestry of martin the warrior  martin and sister amyl appear to martha in a dream  and she is told that the secret to make her able to walk can be found within the ancient walls of loamhedge abbey and that two individuals are coming that can help her  as it so happens  the two in question are bragoon and sarobando  two lifelong friends who ran away from the abbey as dibbuns  they survive by tricking small vermin bands and taking their food  this time  it s the gang of the weasel burrad  whose numbers are at about 13  after bragoon enters the camp  and skrodd accidentally kills burrad  they tell the gang that they must leave mossflower woods and never return  skrodd has other plans  however  and convinces the gang to head to redwall  where there is a rumor of a magical sword  one night  skrodd gets killed by the rat dargle  who gets decapitated during skrodd s death throes  the bodies are discovered by a young fox named little redd  later named badredd   who convinces the gang he was the one who had killed dargle  they continue on to redwall  though no one really takes the fox seriously  bragoon and sarobando arrive at the abbey during the summer festival and are told martha s sad story and where the cure can be found  they decide to set out to loamhedge  but not before horty s group asks if they can go too  when abbot carrul refuses  the trio create a distraction and escape the abbey  though they wind up being captured by darrats  they are rescued by bragoon and saro  who are not too entirely pleased to see them  since they are already fairly far from the abbey and could risk recapture  however  they are allowed to join the quest  meanwhile  badredd s group has arrived at redwall and hold it under siege by slipping in through the east wall gate  realizing he could do with some more troops  badredd sends flinky and crinktail out to recruit some new vermin  the two stoats unwittingly run into raga bol and his crew  who take over management of besieging the abbey  elsewhere  the group of questers scale the tall cliffs leading to loamhedge and enter a cave to avoid the rain  there they find lonna and exchange stories  lonna encounters martin the warrior s spirit during the night  telling him the whereabouts of raga bol  lonna sets out  and the gang from redwall continue up the cliff face and keep walking to the ancient abbey  at redwall  raga bol continues to try to break into the abbey  after an escapade of using a ladder to scale one of the windows  one sea rat manages to enter the abbey and is about to kill carrul when martha suddenly lunges out of her chair and pushes him away  realizing she now has the ability to stand and all she needed was will power  badredd s group managed to escape the abbey during the battle  and bol sends a rat named blowfly after them  instead of finding the escapees  blowfly encounters lonna  who asks him where the abbey is and then kills him  when lonna arrives at redwall  he manages to kill many sea rats  and due to the efforts of the now mobile martha  gets inside of the main building and is able to snipe out the crew from there  in a last ditch attempt to kill the badger  raga bol tricks lonna into coming out to the open where a group of spear chuckers wait to slay him  things go wrong when lonna seizes bol and uses him as a living shield against the spears  then he goes on a rampage and kills every last rat  in the meantime  the five travelers find a stream but get ambushed by reptiles  fortunately  sarobando sneaks out and gets log a log briggy to help them get out of the ambush  they soon get into another wasteland and get lost  when horty finds a dormouse named toobledum and his pet lizard bubbub  toobledum shows them the way to loamhedge  the expedition to find loamhedge has finally arrived at the dead abbey  but all the things in abbess sylvaticus  grave have rotted away to nothing or turned into dust  rather than return empty pawed  bragoon and saro tell the young ones to wait outside while they write their own cure  essentially saying that one just needs faith in oneself  on the way back  the group encounters the abyss and are attacked by kharanjul the wearet  in an attempt to allow horty  fenna  and springald to get to safety  sarobando and bragoon hold off the oncoming forces  eventually pushing the bridge over the edge of the abyss  though they won the battle  the duo is badly injured  and they die shortly after  ten seasons after they return to the abbey  we find that springald has become abbey recorder  fenna has become abbess  horty has joined the long patrol at salamandastron  adding the nom de guerre  longblade  to his name  lonna has become ruler of salamandastron  and

 the novel is written in three parts   in the first place an account  largely from the perspective of the subsequent defendant  elinor carlisle  of the death of her aunt  laura welman  and the subsequent death of the victim  mary gerrard    secondly an account of poirot s investigation    and  thirdly  a sequence in court  again mainly from elinor s dazed perspective  in the first part  distant cousins elinor carlisle and roddy welman are happily engaged to be married when they receive an anonymous letter claiming that someone is  sucking up  to their wealthy aunt  laura welman  from whom elinor and roddy expect to inherit a sizeable fortune  elinor immediately suspects mary gerrard  the lodgekeeper s daughter  to whom their aunt has taken a considerable liking  they go down to visit their aunt   partly to see her and partly to protect their interests  mrs  welman is helpless after a stroke and speaks of a desire to die  most notably to peter lord  her physician  after a second stroke  she asks elinor to ask the family solicitor to prepare a will under which it is clear that mary is to be a beneficiary  roddy has fallen in love with mary  provoking elinor s jealousy  mrs  welman dies intestate during the night and her estate goes to elinor outright as her only surviving blood relative  subsequently  elinor releases roddy from the engagement and makes moves to settle money on him  which he refuses  and three thousand pounds on mary  which mary accepts   at an impromptu tea party thrown by elinor for mary and nurse hopkins  mary dies of poison that had supposedly been put into a fish paste sandwich  elinor  who has been behaving suspiciously  is put on trial  worse  when the body of her aunt is exhumed it is discovered that both women died of morphine poisoning  elinor had easy access to morphine from a bottle that apparently went missing from nurse hopkins  s bag  in the second part of the novel  poirot is persuaded to investigate the case by peter lord  who is in love with elinor and wants her to be acquitted at all costs  poirot s investigation focuses on a small number of elements  was the poison in the sandwiches  which everyone ate  or something else  such as the tea that was prepared by nurse hopkins and drunk by only mary and herself  what is the secret of mary gerrard s birth  which everyone seems so keen to conceal  is there any significance in the scratch of a thorn on nurse hopkins s wrist  is peter lord right to draw poirot s attention to evidence that someone watching through the window might have poisoned the sandwich  thinking that it would be eaten by elinor  in the third part of the novel  the case appears to go badly for elinor  until her defence unveils three theories that might exonerate her  the first  that mary committed suicide  is difficult for anyone to really believe  and the second  peter lord s theory of the killer outside the window  is unconvincing  but the third theory is poirot s  a torn pharmaceutical label that the prosecution supposed to have held morphine hydrochloride  the poison  had in fact held apomorphine hydrochloride  an emetic  this was revealed because on an ampoule  the m in morphine would be capital    poirot finds a lowercase m nbsp      thus it isn t morphine  the capitalized prefix  apo  had been carefully torn off  nurse hopkins had injected herself with this emetic  apomorphine  in order to vomit the poison that she had ingested in the tea  which explains her quick departure from the table as soon as the tea was consumed that fateful day  her claim to have scratched herself on a thorn is disproved when it is revealed that the rose tree in question was a thornless variety   zephyrine drouhin  if the means were simple  the motive is complex  mary gerrard is not the daughter of eliza and bob gerrard  instead  as poirot has discovered from nurse hopkins in the course of the investigation  she is the illegitimate daughter of laura welman and sir lewis rycroft  which made her the heiress to mrs  welman s estate since she was actually a closer relative than elinor  when nurse hopkins encouraged mary to write a will  mary was prompted to name as beneficiary the woman that she supposed to be her aunt  mary riley  eliza gerrard s sister   in new zealand  mary riley s married name is mary draper  mary draper is none other than nurse hopkins as two witnesses of the defence  amelia mary sedley and edward john marshall  both from new zealand   confirm in court  poirot ends the novel by rebuking peter lord for his clumsy efforts to implicate the hypothetical killer outside the window  he has planted evidence and led poirot to it in a desperate bid to free elinor  lord s momentary embarrassment is presumably alleviated by poirot s assurance that it is to him  and not to her former love roddy  that elinor is now likely to become married ,thriler

police and a doctor  they enter the house through the open study window at the back  and find captain trevelyan s dead body on the floor  dr warren estimates the time of death at between 5 and 6pm  a

fianc    he was not in australia  as first thought  but in england all the time  and the willetts  motive   up to now obscure and a cause of suspicion   for moving into the isolated sittaford house had nothing to do with any connection with captain trevelyan  but was in order to live close to dartmoor prison  an escaped convict  though later recaptured   whose escape from dartmoor prison three days after the murder was engineered by brian pearson  is violet s father  the plan was that  after the escape  her father and brian would live with them in the house as manservants until the danger

duke is an ex chief inspector of scotland yard  emily solves the mystery in hazelmoor after finding captain trevelyan s ski boots hidden in the chimney and two pairs of skis in different sizes  major burnaby is the killer  he cleverly and opportunistically engineered the table movements during the s  ance to make the spirit convey the message that captain trevelyan had been murdered  instead of walking the six miles in two and a half hours after the s  ance  he first went to his own house which was close by  put on skis  and skied the distance in a fraction of that time  he killed captain trevelyan about a quarter to six  then he cleaned his skis  and put them in the cupboard  he hid trevelyan s ski boots in the chimney and put his own in the cupboard with the other ski gear  hoping that the second pair of skis and the fact that they wouldn t fit trevelyan would pass unnoticed  mr rycroft  who is a member of the psychical research society  reassembles five of the six original participants for a second s  ance at sittaford house  the absent mr duke being replaced by brian pearson  the s  ance has scarcely begun  when inspector narracott steps in  in the company of emily and mr duke  and charges major burnaby with the murder of captain trevelyan  emily explains that burnaby had lost a lot of money by buying rotten shares and that his motive for the murder was to keep for himself the cheque for   5000  although he denied it to enderby and the police  he had already received the letter notifying him of the win on the morning of the day on which he murdered trevelyan and which was actually won by captain trevelyan himself  trevelyan would often use burnaby  s name to send in competition solutions because he found sittaford house too grand an address for such

such as a ghostly face appearing just outside her window one night and threatening letters  mrs  leidner confides to nurse leatheran that she had received similar threatening letters several years before that were worded as if written by her dead first husband  they arrived every time she would go out with a new man  then stopped when she broke off the relationship  one of the letters was signed with her late husband s name  she had no letters from him from their short marriage  so she could not ascertain whether the letters were really written by him  no letters arrived when or after

crime  on behalf of dr  leidner  poirot questions everyone informally  it is rapidly apparent to all that the murderer of mrs leidner must be one of us as no  strangers  were seen by anyone  archeologist  servant  or worker  at the house or courtyard in the time when she was murdered  the only entry to the bedroom is from the house  as the one window is barred  and was shut when her body was discovered  miss johnson thought she heard a cry  but disbelieves her own ears when she learns that the window was closed  no way for any sound to reach her  this adds to the tensions in the group  who try to carry on as dr  leidner arranges for his wife s funeral and the local police begin their work  along with poirot  the first round of questions show no obvious suspect  as everyone can account for their time  in the sight of others  poirot considers each in turn  as available or capable of the crime  away from the dig at dr  reilly s home  nurse leatheran tells poirot the story of mrs  leidner s earlier life  her first marriage  its end  and the young brother in law she has not seen in 15 years  poirot speculates that one of the members of the dig may  in fact  be this younger brother  william bosner  two of the young men are the right age  he goes further  wondering if the older men at the dig could be her first husband  as the identity of the body in the train wreck could not be certain  they meet sheila reilly  who adds another perspective on the murdered woman  as one who must have the attention of every man around her  dr  reilly adds his own views  calling her a  belle dame sans merci   poirot considers whether nurse leatheran is safe to return to the house  remarking that murder is a habit  she does return  wanting to properly end her connection with dr  leidner  and to attend the funeral  after the funeral  late in the day  miss johnson is on the roof  nurse leatheran joins her  seeing how very distracted and upset she appears  miss johnson makes clear she has had a new thought about how someone could enter without being seen  but explains nothing  she must think about it more  that night  miss johnson is murdered in her bed  dying with nurse leatheran at her side  trying to revive her  the method was rather vicious  poisoning by hydrochloric acid substituted in the glass of water on her nightstand  she manages to choke out the words  the window  the window   before she dies  nurse leatheran first makes it clear this was no suicide  thinking the words indicate how her water was replaced by the acid    through her window  poirot now has two murders to solve  he considers it a crime passionnel  in which he must understand the character of louise leidner to solve both murders  he solves the crimes  but has no proof  he presents his results to the group at the house  after a day of sending telegrams all over the world  he analyzes each person in turn  before explaining the resolution with its complex motives and surprising events  mrs  leidner and miss johnson were killed by dr  leidner  who is  in fact  frederick bosner  he survived the train crash    but a young swedish archaeologist named erich leidner did not  and was disfigured beyond facial recognition  bosner traded identities with the dead man  fifteen years later  established in the dead man s career  he remarried his wife  who did not recognize him  bosner sent the letters to discourage louise from her other relationships  when bosner re married her under his new identity  he stopped writing them  he saw that louise was falling in love with richard carey  his own friend  if leidner could not have louise  no one could  thus he planned to murder her  in his twisted logic  how did he do it  bosner committed the crime without ever leaving the roof as he sorted pottery  louise leidner took an afternoon rest as her husband and the rest of the team were working  she heard a noise  then saw a mask at her window  she realized this simple mask was the same image that appeared as a head without a body one night a few weeks earlier  no longer afraid and determined to know her tormenter  she opened the window and stuck her head out through the bars  she was then bludgeoned with a heavy stone quern dropped by her husband  above her on the roof  bosner retrieved the murder weapon with the rope tied through a hole in the quern  mrs  leidner cried out briefly    it was this cry that miss johnson heard  bosner altered the scene of the crime before anyone else saw his wife or her room  when he climbed down from the roof as usual to see his wife in her room  he moved her body away from the window  and moved the blood stained rug near the jug and bowl  lastly he shut the window before calling nurse leatheran to the room  while he nursed his grief at this shocking loss  when planning the murder  bosner made every effort to divert suspicion from himself  this is the true reason bosner asked nurse leatheran to join the expedition  the nurse would be his perfect alibi  a competent medical professional on the spot to state the time of death  bosner was on the roof when miss johnson talked with the nurse about her new idea  although she has kept quiet out of loyalty and indecision  bosner realises she may eventually crack  that night he plants the missing murder weapon under her bed while she sleeps  and replaces a glass of water on her bedside table with hydrochloric acid  his notion is that once she is found  everyone will think she murdered louise so she could seduce her husband and  overcome by remorse  killed herself  capt  maitland saw things that way during his first arrival at the house when her death was discovered  however  as poirot points out  drinking hydrochloric acid is an incredibly painful and bizarre way to kill oneself  poirot realized another sort of crime had taken place at the dig  the man louise and nurse leatheran saw looking through the antika room window in that peaceful week was ali yusuf  a known associate of raoul menier  a skilled thief of antiquities  raoul menier joined the expedition disguised as epigraphist father lavigny  a catholic cleric with a wide reputation  he was not known personally to any in the team  allowing this simple ruse  lavigny was too ill to join as planned  menier intercepted the wire declining the invitation to the dig  thus he had a free hand to steal precious artifacts from the dig and replace them with near perfect copies made on site  the two were captured boarding a steamer at beyrouth by the police  who had been warned by poirot  bosner acknowledged everything  regretting miss johnson s murder but not that of louise leidner  not long after  sheila reilly married david emmott  a suitable match  nurse leatheran returned to england  where she would think often of her adventure in the east ,thriler

engaged to rowley  one of several members of the cloade family living nearby  each of them grew dependent on money from gordon cloade  a bachelor who was expected to die and leave his fortune to them  before his death he married rosaleen  invalidating his previous will  as a result  rosaleen inherited gordon s fortune and the entire family now faces financial crises  augmented by the poor state of the economy in the aftermath of world war ii  rosaleen s fortune is jealously guarded by her brother  david hunter  and although various family members manage to wheedle small sums out of rosaleen  david refuses to help frances cloade  whose husband jeremy is on the brink of ruin  a man calling himself enoch arden arrives in the village  and attempts to blackmail david by saying he knows how to find rosaleen s first husband  robert  their conversation in arden s hotel room is overheard by the landlady  who immediately tells rowley cloade  later  arden s body is discovered in his room with his head smashed in  rowley cloade appeals to a detective  hercule poirot  to prove the dead man was robert underhay  and poirot produces major porter  who knew underhay in africa  at the inquest  despite rosaleen s protests that the dead man was not robert  porter confirms that arden was indeed her first husband  the estate will revert to the cloades  rosaleen has a strong alibi for the time of the murder since she was in the london flat that evening  david has only a weak alibi   down from london for the day  he met lynn on his dash to catch the last train to london leaving at 9  20 pm  and evidently telephoned her from the london flat shortly after 11 pm  since the murder is believed to have taken place shortly before 9 pm  he had enough opportunity and motive to be arrested  david s alibi improves when it is discovered that a heavily made up woman in an orange headscarf left arden s room after 10 p m  the investigation shifts back to the female cloades  but poirot discovers that the immediate cause of arden s death may have been smashing his head against a heavy marble mantelpiece  the appearance of a murder may have been created after some form of accidental death  lynn  though engaged to rowley  seems to love david  rowley may be attracted to rosaleen  who seems to be consumed with guilt and fear  major porter apparently commits suicide but leaves no note  it comes to light that arden was actually charles trenton  second cousin to frances cloade  she came up with the plan to blackmail rosaleen after hearing major porter s anecdote from jeremy  although this explains arden s identity  it does not clarify who killed him or who bribed porter to falsely identify the corpse  rosaleen dies in her sleep from an overdose  superintendent spence  the investigating officer  suggests that perhaps she was the murderer    the police have so focused on david s alibi that they subjected hers to little scrutiny  lynn tells rowley that she wishes to marry david hunter  rowley is strangling lynn when poirot stops him  david arrives and poirot explains everything  rowley visited arden  and seeing the physical resemblance to frances  reacted angrily to the deception that was being played  pushed by rowley  arden fell against the mantelpiece and died  rowley saw the opportunity to incriminate david  he smashed in arden s head with fire tongs and left david s lighter at the scene  it was rowley who persuaded porter to give the false identification  carefully employing poirot  who would be sure to go to porter on the basis of that first scene at the club  which rowley also knew of from jeremy  porter s guilt got the better of him and he committed suicide  leaving a note that rowley destroyed  discovering arden s body  david ran for the 9  20 train but missed it    lynn actually saw the smoke from the departing train on the evening  but he convinced her that it was earlier than it was and that he had time to meet her  he then backtracked to the stag  disguised himself as a woman  and played out the scene that established the later time of death  then he returned to the station and called rosaleen  who placed a call to lynn that was delivered by the operator but then cut off  afterward  david spoke to lynn from the station  giving the impression that a single call from london was interrupted  he returned to london on the milk train the next day  of the three deaths  one is accidental  one a genuine suicide  the only true murder was rosaleen s  david had no apparent motive to kill his own sister  especially when it would mean depriving himself of the cloade fortune  but the woman posing as rosaleen was not his sister    his sister was killed during the bombing of gordon cloade s estate two years earlier  the woman posing as rosaleen was one of gordon s housemaids  who became david s lover and his accomplice in obtaining the cloade fortune  now he could kill this accomplice and marry lynn  whom he really loved and who would gain a portion of the fortune through family connections  in the end  no one is tried other than david  rowley is implicated in the deaths of trenton   enoch arden   and porter  and he is guilty of

 superintendent spence informs famed belgian detective hercule poirot of the case of mrs mcginty  an elderly charlady who was apparently killed by her lodger  james bentley  for thirty pounds she kept under a floorboard  bentley is soon to be executed for the crime  but spence does not think he is guilty  poirot agrees to go to the town of broadhinny and investigate the murder further  poirot finds that mrs mcginty often worked as a cleaner at the houses of people in the village  no one wants to talk to poirot  and most agree bentley is the killer  during a search among mrs mcginty s possessions  poirot finds a newspaper from which an article has been cut out  the newspaper is dated a few days before the murder  he later discovers that the missing article is about women connected with famous murder cases  and includes photographs of them  he also discovers that mrs mcginty had purchased a bottle of ink in a local shop shortly before her murder  he concludes that she had recognized one of the women in the article  and had written to the paper in question  someone must have found out about it and then killed her to prevent her from talking  poirot and spence  using the ages of people in the town  conclude that someone is either lily gamboll  who committed murder with a meat cleaver as a child  or eva kane  who had been the love interest who inspired a man to murder his wife and bury her in the cellar  another possibility is that someone is evelyn hope  the daughter of eva kane  shortly afterwards  poirot discovers the murder weapon  a sugar hammer  left around in plain sight at his boarding house and accessible to all the suspects  in an attempt to flush out the murderer  poirot claims to know more than he does and is nearly pushed under an oncoming train  poirot decides to show most of the suspects the photos at a party  mrs upward claims to have seen the photo of lily gamboll  but does not say where  the following day  poirot is contacted by maude williams  who had approached him a few days earlier  telling him that she had known bentley when they worked together briefly for the same estate agents  she told poirot that she liked bentley and did not believe he was guilty or even capable of murdering mrs mcginty  she now offers to help poirot who takes up her offer by getting her to pose as a maid in the house of mrs wetherby  a resident in the village for whom mrs mcginty worked as housekeeper  and whose daughter  deirdre  poirot suspects may have some connection with the circumstances surrounding mrs mcginty s murder  during the maid s night off  mrs upward s son robin  a theatre director and ariadne oliver  a famed mystery novelist who has been working on a theatre adaptation with robin  leave for an evening at the theatre  leaving mrs upward alone at the house  when they return  they find mrs upward strangled to death  she has evidently had coffee with her murderer  and the evidence of lipstick on a coffee cup and perfume in the air points to a woman having committed the crime  mrs upward had invited three people to her house that night   eve carpenter  deirdre henderson and shelagh rendell  any of the three women could be someone from the photographs  additionally  the postmistress s assistant  edna  saw someone with blonde hair enter the house  which points to either carpenter or rendell  as henderson is not blonde  confusing matters even further is the fact that a book is discovered in mrs upward s house with evelyn hope s signature written on the flyleaf  which suggests that mrs upward was actually eva kane  poirot connects the final piece of the puzzle when he finds the photo mrs mcginty saw at maureen summerhayes  house  it is of eva kane and has the inscription   my mother   on the back  now  the story complete  poirot gathers the suspects together and reveals the murderer    robin upward  robin is eva kane s son  evelyn  which in england  can be a man s name as well as a woman s  the same being true of robin  perhaps a clue to the plot device     the child was a boy  not a girl  mrs upward had not known who was the mother of her adopted son  but he realized that any scandal would be to his detriment  mrs mcginty saw the photo of eva kane while working at the upward house and assumed the photo was of mrs upward as a young woman  robin killed her to prevent her from telling anyone who might recognize the photo  mrs upward thought kane s photograph to be similar to a photo robin had shown her of his mother  whose back story he made up  she wanted to confront robin by herself  so she pointed to the wrong photo  that of lily gamboll  to put poirot off the scent  robin  however  sensed the truth and killed her before leaving for the play  then he planted the evidence and made the three calls to make it appear that a woman had committed the crime  at this point robin still had the photo  but rather than destroy it  he kept it and planted it at mrs summerhayes  house in order to incriminate her  but poirot had gone through the drawer earlier and did not see the photo  so he knew it had been planted subsequently  further revelations are also made  eve carpenter wanted to conceal her past for reasons of her own  which was why she didn t cooperate in the investigation  poirot discovers that dr rendell may have killed his first wife  which led mrs rendell to talk about anonymous letters she d received warning her of the fact  poirot now suspects it was dr rendell  convinced that poirot was actually in broadhinny to investigate the death of his first wife  and not that of mrs mcginty  who tried to push him under the oncoming train  not robin  maude williams turns out to be the daughter of eva kane s lover  and has always believed that her mother was murdered by

awkward young man whom the others dismiss as pompous and half mad  he seems to suffer from both a persecution complex and delusions of grandeur  on several occasions he confides to others that he is the illegitimate son of a great man  and claims that powerful enemies are conspiring to keep him from his rightful position  christian gulbrandsen  a member of the stonygates board of trustees and the son of carrie louise s first husband from his previous marriage  arrives unexpectedly to see lewis serrocold  everyone assumes he is there on business  but no one is sure exactly why  after dinner  mr

and mr  gulbrandsen were both concerned that carrie louise s recent poor health was due to deliberate poisoning  at that point  alex restarick  stephen s brother carrie louise s stepsons from her

hall  alex restarick s remarks about stage scenery lead miss marple to reflect on all kinds of stage illusion  such as conjurers who perform magic by using mirrors and stage sets and assistants who are in on the trick  when alex and a boy who claimed to have seen something on the night of the murder are both killed  miss marple realizes who has been behind the plotting at stonygates   lewis serrocold  the attempted poisoning of carrie louise never happened    it was an explanation hastily concocted by serrocold to explain christian gulbrandsen s sudden appearance at stonygates and his secretive conference with mr  serrocold  in fact  gulbrandsen had discovered that mr  serrocold was embezzling from the gulbrandsen trust  and serrocold and his unstable accomplice  edgar lawson  killed him to silence him  the murder was accomplished via illusion and misdirection  as alex restarick and miss marple both eventually realized    behind the scenes  of the interior of the house  which everyone had been focused on  there was a terrace by which someone could exit the study and re enter the house to commit murder without being seen by the rest of the residents  this was what mr  serrocold had done  while lawson  using his acting talents and different voices  had continued both sides of the loud argument by himself  when confronted by the police  edgar lawson panics and flees the house  jumping into an old boat in an attempt to cross a lake on the property  the boat is rotted though  and as it begins to sink  lewis serrocold jumps into the lake to rescue his accomplice

 the story flashes back three months to ramat  one of the richest countries of the middle east  where a revolution is about to take place  prince ali yusuf gives a fortune in jewels  which he needs sent out of the country  into the safekeeping of bob rawlinson  his personal pilot and the only person he can trust  rawlinson complies with the prince s request  apparently by concealing the jewels in the luggage of his sister  joan sutcliffe  who is travelling with her daughter  jennifer  he is seen doing this by a mysterious and unnamed woman in the next room  soon after  both rawlinson and the prince are killed in an airplane crash while attempting to leave the country after a flight mechanic named sergeant achmed sabotages their plane  a number of people  including british intelligence  get onto the trail of the jewels  and their attention focuses on meadowbank school  where not only jennifer  but also the prince s cousin and expected fianc  e  shaista  are studying  this term at meadowbank there are both old and new staff  miss chadwick helped miss bulstrode found the school  miss vansittart has been teaching there for several years  and miss rich for 1 1 2 years  miss johnson is the girls  matron  the new staff include ang  le blanche  a french teacher   grace springer  a gym teacher   ann shapland  miss bulstrode s new secretary   and adam goodman  a gardener  or actually an undercover british agent posing as a gardener   miss bulstrode is nearing retirement  and is deciding whom to appoint as her successor  the others assume miss vanisttart will be the successor    she would perserve miss bulstrode s legacy but is unimaginative and has no new ideas  but miss bulstrode is also considering miss rich  who is young and has lots of ideas but less experience  she is not considering miss chadwick  whom she thinks is too old  although others may assume miss chadwick is the second most likely candidate   but all these deliberations are cut short when miss springer is shot dead in the sports pavilion late at night  and miss johnson and miss chadwick discover her body  following the murder  inspector kelsey interviews everyone and adam goodman reveals his true identity to miss bulstrode  meanwhile  jennifer sutcliffe  an expert tennis player  complains that her racquet feels unbalanced  it must have been warped in the ramat heat   and she writes to her mother asking for a new one  she swaps tennis racquets with julia upjohn  who prefers jennifer s racquet because it has been refurbished recently  later a strange woman arrives and gives jennifer a new racquet  saying it s a gift from her aunt gina  the woman takes the old racquet  actually julia s   ostensibly to return it to aunt gina for restringing  later  julia points out that this is impossible because aunt gina knows that jennifer s racquet had been refurbished and restrung recently  so she would not assume the problem is in the strings  sure enough  aunt gina writes to say that she has not sent a new racquet  during a weekend when many of the girls are at home with their parents  shaista is apparently kidnapped by a chauffeur posing as the one sent by her uncle to take her home  that night there is a repetition of murder when miss chadwick is disturbed by torch light in the sports pavilion and miss vansittart is found dead there  having been apparently coshed  many of the girls go home  but the resourceful julia  who has been pondering the exchange of the racquets  takes her  really jennifer s  racquet back to her room and discovers the gems in the hollowed out handle  she hears someone at the door who quietly turns the knob and attempts to enter  but julia has pushed furniture against the door to prevent a murderer from entering  the next day julia flees the school to tell her story to hercule poirot  whom she has heard of through a friend of her mother  the police start to focus on the newcomer  miss blanche  but in fact she is not the murderer  instead  she knows who the murderer is  and makes an attempt at blackmail that backfires when she is also killed  with the school struggling to survive the scandal of two murders  the denouement has arrived  poirot reviews what the reader already knows  and then explains that princess shaista was an impostor   the real shaista had been kidnapped earlier in switzerland  and the apparent abduction was actually the imposter s escape from the school  she was the representative of one group of interests who  crucially  did not know where the gems had been concealed  the murderer  however  did know where the jewels were concealed and must have been in ramat to see bob rawlinson hide them  most of the teachers could not have been there    the exception was eileen rich  who was apparently sick at the time but was in fact in ramat  jennifer had even recognised her  although she remembered the woman she had seen as a fatter woman   it later transpires that miss rich had been in ramat for the delivery of an illegitimate child that was stillborn   just as it seems that miss rich is the murderer  mrs  upjohn enters the room having been recalled from her holiday in anatolia and identifies by face the woman she had seen through mrs bulstrode s window   ann shapland  who is well known in intelligence circles as a ruthless espionage agent and a mercenary  it was shapland who had had the room next to bob rawlinson at the start of the book  ann shapland draws a pistol and miss bulstrode steps in front of mrs  sutcliffe    miss chadwick does the same to protect miss bulstrode  and is fatally wounded  it is revealed that ann shapland murdered miss springer  who caught her while she was searching the sports pavilion for the jewels  she also murdered miss blanche  who knew her secret and tried to blackmail her  but she did not kill miss vansittart  and had a perfect alibi for that night  miss vansittart was actually killed by miss chadwick  in an unpremedited fit of passion  miss chadwick had found miss vansittart in the sports pavilion the second night  kneeling in front of shaista s locker  apparently snooping  miss chadwick disliked miss vansittart and did not consider her a suitable successor for meadowbank  miss chadwick was carrying a sandbag for protection  and here was miss vansittart in a perfect position to be coshed from behind  barely conscious of her actions  she kills her  but she feels immediate remorse  and later throws herself in front of a bullet to save miss bulstrode  as miss chadwick lies dying  she confesses that she imagined the removal of the widely presumed successor would make miss bulstrode change her mind about retiring  so the first and third murders are linked by the same murderer  while the second and third murders are linked by the same method  a sandbag   shapland used the sandbag to make it seem that the second and third murders were linked  since she had an alibi for the second murder  at the end of the book  miss bulstrode reconfirms her decision to make miss rich her eventual successor  poirot turns over the gems to the enigmatic   mr  robinson   who  in turn  delivers them to the english woman who has been secretly married to prince ali yusuf  one emerald is returned as a reward to julia upjohn ,thriler

 it is while visiting wilbraham crescent one afternoon on his own business that special branch agent colin   lamb   takes the terrified sheila into his arms  he is investigating areas connected with crescents or the moon while following up a clue to the route by which classified information is leaving the country  the clue is a note found in a dead agent s pocket    letter m  number 61  and a sketch of a crescent moon are all that is written on a bit of hotel stationery  sketched in the book   at 19 wilbraham crescent  home of the blind miss pebmarsh  a police investigation begins into the murder  the dead man has a business card in his pocket indicating that the bearer is an insurance salesman called r  h  curry  neither the company nor the salesman are real  police learn soon  the clothing reveal nothing else  as all labels have been removed  he was killed by a knife  an ordinary kitchen knife  a colourful group of neighbours is interviewed by inspector hardcastle with his friend lamb in attendance as his note taking sergeant  the neighbouring homes adjoin the murder site on the street or from the back gardens in this unusually arranged victorian housing development  the most interesting of the neighbours to colin is the ramsey family   the husband popped off for business travel days after his boys came home for the school vacation  as he does frequently for his  constructional  profession  he is clearly taken with sheila  an extra motive to aid his friend  the inspector  things look bleak for sheila when the aunt who raised her  mrs  lawton  is questioned by hardcastle  her niece s full name is rosemary sheila  but the girl preferred sheila from age 6  rosemary is the name on a leather travel clock found at the scene of the murder  but lost before the police gathered up the clocks set to the incorrect time  frustrated  colin approaches hercule poirot  an old friend of his father  to investigate the case  he challenges poirot to do so from his armchair as he had always claimed was possible  he leaves the celebrated detective with detailed notes on the investigation thus far  the celebrated detective accepts the challenge  then instructs colin to talk with the neighbors beyond the initial interviews with inspector hardcastle  at the inquest in crowdean  the medical examiner reveals that the victim had been given a  micky finn   chloral hydrate in alcohol  before he was murdered  after the inquest  edna brent  one of sheila  s fellow secretaries  expresses her confusion at something said in evidence  what she said couldn t be true  she tells the young officer she first encounters  she attempts to draw it to hardcastle  s attention  but that lower level officer deflects her  within hours  she is found dead in a telephone box on wilbraham crescent  strangled with her own scarf  the dead man s identity proves hard to discover  further frustrating hardcastle  a letter from a woman called mrs  merlina rival  original name flossie gapp  seems the first solid lead  she appears  identifies the dead man as her one time husband  harry castleton  after careful questioning by the inpsector  in that week  colin has left britain on his own case  travelling behind the iron curtain to romania  he returns with the information he needed  but not the person he hoped to find  following poirot s advice  colin seeks to talk with the neighbors  he makes an important discovery in a ten year old girl  geraldine brown  who lives in the apartment block on the other side of the street  she has been observing the events at wilbraham crescent with a pair of opera glasses while confined to her room with a broken leg  she records events of interest  she reveals that a new laundry service delivered a heavy basket of laundry on the morning of the murder  colin shares his discovery with hardcastle  mrs  rival wrote to the police to state that her late husband had a scar behind his left ear  meeting her in london  hardcastle tells her the scar is only a few years old  per medical examination  long after she had last seen him  upset at this news  she calls the person who involved her in this case  despite a police  tail  on her to find this link  she is found dead at victoria tube station  stabbed in the back  three murders now  the bodies are piling up  and the police are no closer to resolving their case  hardcastle has one firm fact   mrs  rival was hired by the murderer to make the identification she did  and then killed for it  poirot  s initial view of this case is that the appearance of complexity must conceal quite a simple murder  the clocks are therefore a red herring  as is the presence of sheila  and the removal of the dead man s wallet  tailor marks in the clothing  colin updates poirot on succeeding visits  teasing him for not yet finding the solution  poirot took a room in a crowdean hotel to tell inspector hardcastle and colin lamb what he has deduced  from a careful chronology of events  he deduces what edna realised  she returned early to the secretarial bureau from lunch the day of the murder because of damage to her shoe  unnoticed by her boss  miss martindale  edna knows that miss martindale took no telephone call at the time she testified that she had  thus only one person had motive to murder poor edna  from that fictitious call  the boss sent sheila to miss pebmarsh  s house for steno typing service  miss pebmarsh steadfastly denied ever requesting this service  mrs  bland  one of the neighbors of 19 wilbraham crescent  mentioned she had a sister in the initial interview with insp  hardcastle  poirot deduced the identity of this sister  miss martindale  owner of cavendish secretarial and typewriting bureau  is the sister of mrs  bland  her typing service specialized in readying author s texts for publication  mystery authors and a few writers of seamy romances  the present mrs  bland is the second mrs  bland  also deduced by poirot  mr  bland said his wife was the sole living relative for her family inheritance    how could she be sole heir and have a sister  at the same time  mr  bland married in the war  but his wife was killed overseas in that same war    he remarried soon after  another canadian woman  the canadian family of his first wife had disapproved of him  cut off communication with their daughter so thoroughly that they did not know she was dead  some 16 years later  the first wife was heiress to an overseas fortune  thought to be the last living relative  when news of it reached the blands  they decided that the second mrs  bland must pose as the heiress in order to obtain the money  rather than admit the death  the couple succeeded in fooling the british law firm that sought the heir on behalf of the canadian firm handling the will  when quentin duguesclin  who knew the first wife and her family  decided to look her up in england more than a year later  a plan was laid to murder him  the plan was simple  with additions like the clocks taken from an unpublished mystery story whose author had been a close client of miss martindale  she was avaricious and brutal but not imaginative  mrs  rival was murdered before she could tell the police who asked her to make the false identification  just as edna had been killed before she revealed what she inadvertently knew  mr  bland and his sister in law thought their plan would baffle the police  while mrs  bland felt she was a pawn in their schemes  rather than the full partner she was  mr  bland took care to dispose of mr  duguesclin s passport on a quick trip to boulogne  which trip he was bold enough to mention to colin in casual conversation  again proving poirot s point that people reveal much in simple conversation  poirot has assumed this trip  so the man s passport would be found in a country different than where he was murdered  and long after friends and family in canada had missed him on his vacation in europe  the missing clock  the one with rosemary written in faded letters  was traced as well  colin realized that sheila had taken it that afternoon  seeing it was her very own clock  mislaid on the way to a repair shop  she tossed it in the neighbor s trash  but she had not mislaid it initially    her boss  miss martindale  had taken it as part of her murder plot  following poirot s resolution of the motives for these murders  colin sees his error in reading the note he carries  turned upside down  it points him to 19 wilbraham crescent  miss pebmarsh is the center of the ring passing information to the other side in the cold war  using braille system to encode their messages  he has decided to marry sheila and realizes that miss pebmarsh is the real mother of his love  a true gentleman  he gives miss pebmarsh two hours warning of the net about to close around her  soon to be his mother in law  she chose her cause over her child once  and does so again  finding a knife to defend herself  colin disarms her  and the two wait for the arrest  each secure that their convictions are the true ones  the novel closes with two letters from inspector hardcastle to poirot  telling him police have found all the hard evidence to close the case  mrs  bland  cracked  under questioning  and admitted all  the two plots are tied in several points  but one is clever  colin initially seeks  but did not find  61 wilbraham crescent  that is home to the blands  who committed the murder that hardcastle and poirot want to solve  initially  the blands are not suspected in the murder at all  and of no interest to colin  the murdered body was found in 19 wilbraham crescent  a murder in which the owner had no involvement  instead  it was the home of the person whom colin sought  center of the spy ring  miss

back in the mines as if nothing had happened  and i also attended my business  after nightfall  we gathered in hyde hall under the cover of darkness and signed the charter  with the signing of our names  we took the oath of silence  so i cannot speak of these things  but only write them secretly  the trouble is over  but i am no happier  i am afraid of what we have done  i am afraid of tomorrow

 in his book  the world is flat  friedman recounts a journey to bangalore  india  when he realized globalization has changed core economic concepts  in his opinion  this flattening is a product of a convergence of personal computer with fiber optic micro cable with the rise of work flow software  he termed this period as globalization 3 0  differentiating this period from the previous globalization 1 0  in which countries and governments were the main protagonists  and the globalization 2 0  in which multinational companies led the way in driving global integration   friedman recounts many examples of companies based in india and china that  by providing labor from typists and call center operators to accountants and computer programmers  have become integral parts of complex global supply chains for companies such as dell  aol  and microsoft  friedman s dell theory of conflict prevention is discussed in the book s penultimate chapter  friedman repeatedly uses lists as an organizational device to communicate key concepts  usually numbered  and often with a provocative label  two example lists are the ten forces that flattened the world  and three points of convergence  friedman defines ten  flatteners  that he sees as leveling the global playing field      1   collapse of the berlin wall  ndash    11 9 89   friedman called the flattener   when the walls came down  and the windows came up   the event not only symbolized the end of the cold war  it allowed people from the other side of the wall to join the economic mainstream   11 9 89  is a discussion about the berlin wall coming down  the  fall  of communism  and the impact that windows powered pcs  personal computers  had on the ability of individuals to create their own content and connect to one another  at that point  the basic platform for the revolution to follow was created   ibm pc  windows  a standardized graphical interface for word processing  dial up modems  a standardized tool for communication  and a global phone network     2   netscape  ndash    8 9 95   netscape went public at the price of  28  netscape and the web broadened the audience for the internet from its roots as a communications medium used primarily by  early adopters and geeks  to something that made the internet accessible to everyone from five year olds to ninety five year olds  the digitization that took place meant that everyday occurrences such as words  files  films  music  and pictures could be accessed and manipulated on a computer screen by all people across the world     3   workflow software   friedman s catch all for the standards and technologies that allowed work to flow  the ability of machines to talk to other machines with no humans involved  as stated by friedman  friedman believes these first three forces have become a  crude foundation of a whole new global platform for collaboration   there was an emergence of software protocols  smtp  ndash    simple mail transfer protocol    html  ndash    the language that enabled anyone to design and publish documents that could be transmitted to and read on any computer anywhere  standards on standards  this is what friedman called the  genesis moment of the flat world   the net result  is that people can work with other people on more stuff than ever before   this created a global platform for multiple forms of collaboration  the next six flatteners sprung from this platform     4   uploading   communities uploading and collaborating on online projects  examples include open source software  blogs  and wikipedia  friedman considers the phenomenon  the most disruptive force of all      5   outsourcing   friedman argues that outsourcing has allowed companies to split service and manufacturing activities into components which can be subcontracted and performed in the most efficient  cost effective way  this process became easier with the mass distribution of fiber optic cables during the introduction of the world wide web     6   offshoring   the internal relocation of a company s manufacturing or other processes to a foreign land to take advantage of less costly operations there  china s entrance in the wto  world trade organization  allowed for greater competition in the playing field  now countries such as malaysia  mexico  brazil must compete against china and each other to have businesses offshore to them     7   supply chaining   friedman compares the modern retail supply chain to a river  and points to wal mart as the best example of a company using technology to streamline item sales  distribution  and shipping     8   insourcing   friedman uses ups as a prime example for insourcing  in which the company s employees perform services  ndash    beyond shipping  ndash    for another company  for example  ups repairs toshiba computers on behalf of toshiba  the work is done at the ups hub  by ups employees     9   informing   google and other search engines are the prime example   never before in the history of the planet have so many people  ndash    on their own  ndash    had the ability to find so much information about so many things and about so many other people   writes friedman  the growth of search engines is tremendous    for example take google  in which friedman states that it is  now processing roughly one billion searches per day  up from 150 million just three years ago      10    the steroids    wireless  voice over internet  and file sharing  personal digital devices like mobile phones  ipods  personal digital assistants  instant messaging  and voice over internet protocol  voip   digital  mobile  personal and virtual  ndash    all analog content and processes  from entertainment to photography to word processing  can be digitized and therefore shaped  manipulated and transmitted    virtual  ndash    these processes can be done at high speed with total ease    mobile  ndash    can be done anywhere  anytime by anyone    and personal  ndash    can be done by you  thomas friedman believes that to fight the quiet crisis of a flattening world  the united states work force should keep updating its work skills  making the work force more adaptable  friedman argues  will keep it more employable  he also suggests that the government make it easier to switch jobs by making retirement benefits and health insurance less dependent on one s employer and by providing insurance that would partly cover a possible drop in income when changing jobs  friedman also believes there should be more inspiration for youth to be scientists  engineers  and mathematicians due to a decrease in the percentage of these professionals being american ,fantasy

 franz werfel had first served as a corporal and telephone operator in the artillery corps of the austro hungarian army during the first world war on the russian front and later as a propaganda writer for the military press bureau  with rainer maria rilke and others  in vienna  his experience of the horrors he witnessed during the war as well as the banality of the civil and military bureaucracies served him well during the course of writing the book  his reason for writing the novel came as a result of a trip through palestine  syria  and lebanon in the winter and spring of 1930  and is given in a prefatory note in the novel   this book was conceived in march of the year 1929  sic   during the course of a stay in damascus  the miserable sight of maimed and famished looking refugee children  working in a carpet factory  gave me the final impulse to snatch the incomprehensible destiny of the armenian people from the hell of all that had taken place  the writing of the book followed between july 1932 and march 1933  meanwhile  in november  on a lecture tour through german cities  the author selected chapter 5 of book one for public readings  it was read in its present form  based on the historic records of a conversation between enver pasha and pastor johannes lepsius  werfel does not mention here that the completely rewrote much of the novel in may 1933  responding to events in nazi germany  and kept revising it up until it was published  later  speaking to reporters  werfel elaborated     34   the struggle of 5 000 people on musa dagh had so fascinated me that i wished to aid the armenian people by writing about it and bringing it to the world   34    werfel  s narrative style is omniscient as well as having a polyfocus in which he moves from character to character as well as being an overarching spectator  for that reason  the connection between the author  s consciousness and that of his characters can almost read seamlessly  this is evident as the novel opens in the spring of 1915  during the second year of the world war i  gabriel bagradian  a wealthy armenian from paris  has returned to his native village of yoghonoluk  one of seven villages in hatay province  his view is dominated by a familiar and looming presence in this paradisiac landscape  musa dagh  which means mt  moses in armenian  he thinks about his return to settle the affairs of his dead older brother and entertains pleasant reveries of his childhood as well as more serious matters  bagradian feels both proud and estranged from his armenian roots  and werfel develops this theme of estrangement throughout the novel and which is denoted with the book  s first sentence  a question     how did i get here    bagradian also considers his french wife juliette and their son stephan and how they will adjust to their new environment given the state of war that now exists and prevents their return  other important characters are introduced in book one   juliette  stephan  and the many armenian characters  chief among them the gregorian head priest  ter haigasun  the local physician  dr  altouni  and the apothecary  polymath krikor  and the greek american journalist  gonzague maris  all characters drawn from armenian survivors of the events of 1915 as well as from werfel  s family  friends  acquaintances  and himself  indeed  he informs several characters ranging from the idealized outsider  hero gabriel bagradian to self parody  the schoolteacher oskanian   bagradian considers himself a loyal citizen of the ottoman empire  even a patriot  eschewing the more radical armenian parties  such as the socialist hunchaks  he had served as an artillery officer in the 1912 balkan war and had been involved in the progressive wing of turkish politics and had been a vocal armenian supporter of the cup and the young turk revolution  of 1908  being a reserve officer  bagradian becomes suspicious when he is not called up  learning that turkish authorities have seized the internal passports of armenian citizens further fuels his suspicions  so he goes to the district capital of antakya  i e   antioch  to inquire about his military status  in a turkish bath  he overhears a group of turks  among them the district governor  the kaimikam  discussing the central government  s plan to do something about its armenian problem  bagradian is alarmed by what he hears and the dangers given the history of atrocities committed on armenians  whose rise as the empire  s chief professional and mercantile class has alarmed turkish nationalists  the dangers that this poses to his family are all corroborated by an old friend of the bagradian family  agha rifaat bereket  a pious dervish  a sufi muslim ascetic who sees the young turks as apostates  back in yoghonoluk  bagradian begins socialize with the armenian community  his grandfather had a paternal relationship with the armenian villages that dot the land around musa dagh  a role that gabriel bagradian assumes not to be a real leader but more to help his french wife acclimate to what could be a long exile in the turkish levant  despite the rumors of arrests and deportations trickling in from istanbul and other ottoman cities  many of musa dagh  s armenians remain unconcerned about the outside world  it is not until four refugees arrive in yoghonoluk in late april that the full nature of what the ottoman government is doing becomes clear  for the refugees bring news of the brutal suppression of an armenian uprising in the city of zeitun and the mass deportation that followed  in a long passage  werfel tells the story of zeitun and introduces three more important characters of the book  the protestant pastor aram tomasian  his pregnant wife hovsannah  his sister iskuhi  as well as the quasi feral orphan girl sato and kevork  a houseboy who had suffered brain damage as a child at the hands of the turks  iskuhi  too  is a victim of a more recent atrocity  her left arm is paralyzed from fending off a rape attempt  despite her deformity  the armenian girl  s beauty and eyes attract bagradian  the story the refugees tell causes bagradian and the armenians who live around musa dagh to seriously consider resisting the ottomans  bagradian steps forward to assess the strengths and weaknesses of the villages and looks to the natural defenses of musa dagh and its environs  ter haigasun becomes his ally in convincing the armenian villagers of the peril that is coming  book one also introduces the readers to the german protestant missionary johannes lepsius  a real person  and his audience with enver pasha  the ottoman war minister  one of the three pashas  which also included talaat pasha and djemal pasha  the triumvirate that ruled the ottoman empire  the chapter  titled   interlude of the gods    reveals the turkish point of view vis    vis the armenians and the west  werfel intended his depiction  almost entirely drawn verbatim from lepsius  s published account  to be both sympathetic and damning  especially when enver consults with talaat on the progress of the deportations  the remainder of book one describes which armenians decide on resistance and which on cooperating with the deportation order  bagradian camps out with his family and friends on musa dagh to ensure that it is the right place to make a stand  those who decide to resist dig up a secret cache of rifles left over from the revolution of 1908  when they were allies of the young turks  and the subsequent burial of their church bells so that these do not fall into turkish hands  eventually the ottoman military police arrive  the dreaded saptiehs  led by the red haired m  dir  they instruct the armenians to prepare for deportations  and then leave after beating ter haigasun and bagradian  instead  the 6 000 armenians march with everything they can carry  their animals  and their weapons to a plateau on musa dagh  bagradian hangs behind and observes the wailing women and the other graveyard folk  who represent the old ways and sympathetic magic of pagan armenia  sacrifice a goat  its meaning is propitious as well as cautionary  the chapter ends with bagradian helping krikor carry the last volumes of his magnificent if eclectic library to the damlayik  the plateau where the armenians have chosen as their refuge  book two opens during the high summer of 1915 and with the establishment of the armenian encampment and defenses  the town enclosure  three tent square  south bastion  dish terrace  and other sites on musa dagh that become familiar placenames during the course of werfel  s novel  a division of labor  too  is established as to who will fight  who will care for livestock  who will make guns and munitions  and so on  indeed  a communal society is established despite the objections of the propertied class  the objective is to hold out long enough to attract the ships of the british and french navies that patrol the eastern mediterranean in support of the allied invasion of gallipoli  characters who will figure in the defense of the mountain also come into more relief  such as the loner and ottoman army deserter sarkis kilikian  who suffered the loss of his entire family during the pogrom like hamidian massacres  and the former drillmaster  chaush nurhan  indeed  musa dagh is presented as a microcosm of late nineteenth  and early twentieth century armenian life as well as being a test not only of bagradian  s leadership  but a test of his marriage and fatherhood  the ottoman soldiers and saptiehs seriously underestimate the armenians and their first engagement results in a turkish rout  the victory forces the turks to assemble a larger force  and it enhances bagradian  s reputation as well as reconnects him to his people  and isolates him from juliette and stephan  stephan  too  reconnects with his armenian roots  but the difficulty he experiences because of his westernized childhood makes the novel a coming of age story as well as a classic tale of love and war on the scale of leo tolstoy  s war and peace  he wants to be an authentic armenian  like his rival haik and other boys  to prove himself to them  stephan organizes a raid on a fruit orchard to replenish the armenians   stores  and to prove himself to iskuhi  for he is as much bewitched by her as his father  he leaves musa dagh to fetch back iskuhi  s bible  left behind in his father  s deserted house   a long passage left out of the first english translation   juliette apprehends the growing estrangement of her husband and son and seeks purpose and solace in nursing the armenian wounded and her friendship with gonzague maris  which develops into a passionate affair  as the turks resume their attacks  he tries to convince juliette to abandon her family and the mountain  the battles include a heroic stand led by kilikian as well as stephan  s sniping attack on a turkish gun emplacement  he and the other boys seize two cannons  a feat that forces the turks to withdraw  book two features a traditional funeral for the armenian dead  including the ceremonies of the wailing women  who assist in the birth aram tomasian  s son  a difficult delivery that is seen as ominous while conditions in the camp start to deteriorate  for the armenian victories can only buy time  jemal pasha is introduced in book two and is portrayed as a resentful member of the triumvirate pathologically jealous of enver  the relationship between bagradian and iskuhi also comes into focus as it is conducted openly but only consummated on a spiritual plane  their love  however  is interrupted by a reinforced ottoman attack  which is repelled  bagradian  too  orders a massive forest fire to surround the armenian encampment with a no man  s land of fire  smoke  and open terrain  book two ends with sato  s exposing juliette and gonzague making love  juliette  s coming down with typhus  and gonzague  s escape  stephan  too  leaves the camp to accompany haik on a mission to contact the american envoy in antioch  the scene now changes to istanbul and johannes lepsius  s meeting with members of a dervish order called the   thieves of the art    it was important to werfel to show that the young turks and the three pashas did not represent turkish society as a whole  it was also important to show that even enver was right on certain points in regard to the western powers  which had exploited turkey and treated it throughout the nineteenth century as a virtual colony  for this reason  most of the first chapter of book three is written as a dramatic dialogue during which lepsius witnesses the sufi whirling devotions and learns firsthand about the deep resentment against the west  especially western   progress   as instituted by the young turks  and the atrocities in the concentration camps set up in the mesopotamian desert for deported armenians  he also encounters bagradian  s friend  agha rifaat bereket  the latter agrees to bring supplies to musa dagh purchased with funds collected by lepsius in germany  the episode ends with lepsius witnessing enver and talaat being driven past in a limousine  when the car suffers two loud tire punctures  lepsius at first thinks they have been assassinated  which foreshadows the real deaths of talaat and djemal pasha by armenian assassins   the chapter that follows resumes with stephan and haik  they encounter the inshaat taburi  the notorious forced labor details composed of armenian draftees into the ottoman army  and travel through a swamp  where stephan and haik form a real friendship  it is cut short  however  when stephan falls ill and is cared for by a turkmen farmer  another of the righteous muslims that werfel represents in the forty days of musa dagh  too sick to continue on the mission to antioch  stephan is returned to yoghonoluk  which has been resettled by muslim refugees from war zones of the ottoman empire  there  stephan is discovered to be bagradian  s son and a spy  and is brutally murdered  stephan  s death causes bagradian to withdraw for a time  during which turkish soldiers capture the last of the armenian livestock  this disaster opens up rifts in musa dagh  s society and resolve  other setbacks follow  with the arrival of a seasoned ottoman general from the gallipoli front as well as reinforcements from the regular army  the ottomans begin to tighten the noose around musa dagh  meanwhile  bagradian recovers from his grief to form guerrilla bands to disrupt the ottoman advance and buy more time  but no ships have been sighted  and the various attempts to contact the allies or to seek the diplomatic intercession of the united states  still a neutral power  or turkey  s ally  imperial germany  come to naught  bagradian derives strength  and comfort  from iskuhi  who has volunteered to care for juliette  nevertheless  iskuhi sees the end coming and the likelihood that their love entails dying together  not a life  when the agha  s mission arrives  he finds the armenians starving  he can do little  though since the red haired m  dir has confiscated most of the supplies intended for the armenians as a humanitarian gesture despite the approval of turkey  s highest religious authority  the camp  filled with smoke from the forest fires  inspires a vision in him that disturbingly anticipates the holocaust and the death camps of world war ii  the armenian camp and resistance also faces its greatest challenge from within when criminal elements among the ottoman army deserters  who bagradian allowed to help in musa dagh  s offense  go on a rampage  as ter haigasun prepares to celebrate a mass to ask for god  s help  the deserters set the altar on fire and the resulting conflagration destroys much of the town enclosure before the uprising is suppressed by bagradian  s men  the ottomans  seeing the fire  now prepare for the final assault  oskanian leads a suicide cult for those who do not want to die given the turks   reputation for violent reprisals  the little teacher  however  refuses to jump off a cliff himself after fending off the last of his followers  soon after  he discovers the large red cross distress flag the armenians flew to attract allied ships and sights the french cruiser guichen in the fog  it had diverted course after its watch spotted the burning of the armenian camp on musa dagh from out at sea  as oskanian waves the flag  the warship begins shelling the coast  soon more ships come  the turks withdraw and the armenians are rescued  bagradian remains behind after ensuring that the people he led  juliette  and iskuhi are safely aboard the french and british ships  his reasons are complex and can be traced throughout the novel to the realization that he cannot leave and go into exile again in an internment camp in port said  egypt  he thinks iskuhi follows him back up musa dagh from the sea  on the way  he experiences a divine presence and confronts the cross on his son  s grave  he is followed  however  by a skirmishing party of turkish troops  they approach in a crescent  which alludes to the battle formations of the ottoman armies of the past  and kill bagradian with a sniper  s headshot ,mystery
 while most of the novel concentrates on stephen s life in france before and during the war  the novel also focuses on the life of stephen s granddaughter  elizabeth  and her attempts to find out more about her grandfather s experiences in world war i  the story is split into seven sections which cover three different time periods  birdsong has an episodic structure which moves between three different periods of time before  during and after the war  this is similar in many ways to the structure faulks would adopt in his later novel the long white winter  throughout the novel there are echoes of several war poets such as siegfried sassoon and wilfred owen  1918  the first stage is set before the war in amiens  france  stephen wraysford is sent by his wealthy but disempassioned

stephen hears no more of her and knows nothing of his child that she bears  a girl called fran  oise  and later raises with a german soldier called max  we rejoin stephen some years later as a lieutenant in the british army and through his eyes  faulks tells the reader about the battle of the somme and ms ridge at ypres in the following year  the energetic character described in the first chapter of the novel contrasts with the depiction of stephen hardened by his experiences of war  during his time in the trenches  we learn of stephen s mental attitude to the war and the guarded comradeship he feels for his friend captain michael weir and the rest of his men  however  wraysford is regarded as a cold and distant officer by his men  he refuses all offers of leave    so committed is he to fighting and staying involved with the war  his story is paralleled to that of jack firebrace  a former miner  employed in the british trenches to listen for the enemy and plant mines under the german trenches  jack is particularly motivated to fight because of the love he has for his deceased son john back home  faulks describes how a soldier called hunt is terrified of going underground as an exploding shell could trap the soldiers underground causing them to suffocate  stephen is injured in this chapter but survives  the troops are told to make an attack on the hawthorne ridge but the attack seems doomed to fail with the senior officers being blamed  gray states that stephen should not tell his men that the attack will fail but should pray for them instead  stephen feels lonely and writes to isabelle  feeling that he has no one else that he can express his feelings to  he writes about his fears that he will die  and confesses that he has only ever loved

being trapped underground    firebrace dies but stephen survives and as the war ends he is rescued by levi  a jewish german soldier  an ending which is clearly inspired by    and deliberately echoes    wilfred owen s 1918 poem  strange meeting   elizabeth finally decides to reveal her pregnancy to her mother  who is surprisingly supportive  over dinner  she learns her mother was raised by stephen and jeanne  who married and settled in norfolk  after isabelle  s premature death due to the postwar influenza epidemic  elizabeth and robert then go on holiday to dorset where she goes into labour

where he sells folk remedies  the action moves to an english sea coast  on the night of january 29  1690  a group of wanderers  their identities left unrevealed to the reader  are urgently loading a ship for departure  a boy  ten years old  is among their company  but they leave him behind and cast off  the desperate boy  barefoot and starving  wanders through a snowstorm and reaches a gibbet  where he finds the corpse of a hanged criminal  the dead man is wearing shoes   utterly worthless to him now  yet precious to this boy  in the meantime  the wanderers  ship sinks after a long struggle with the sea in the english channel  after walking some more  the boy finds a ragged woman  frozen to death  he is about to move onward when he hears a sound within the woman s garments   he discovers an infant girl  barely alive  clutching the woman s breast  hugo s narrative describes a single drop of frozen milk  resembling a pearl  suspended from the dead woman s nipple  although the boy s survival seems unlikely  he now takes possession of the infant in an attempt to keep her alive  the girl s eyes are sightless and clouded  and he understands that she is blind  in the snowstorm  he encounters an isolated caravan  the domicile of ursus  the action shifts forward 15 years  to england during the reign of queen anne  duchess josiana  a spoiled and jaded peeress  and illegitimate daughter of king james ii   is bored by the dull routine of court  her fiance  david dirry moir  the illegitimate son of a proscribed baron and to whom she has been engaged since infancy  tells the duchess that the only cure for her boredom is  gwynplaine   although he does not divulge who or what this gwynplaine might be  ursus is now 15 years older  the wolf homo is still alive too  although the narration admits that his fur is greyer  gwynplaine is the abandoned boy  now 25 years old and matured to well figured manhood  in a flashback  during the first encounter between ursus and gwynplaine  the boy is clutching the nearly dead infant  and ursus is outraged that the boy appears to be laughing  when the boy insists that he is not laughing  ursus takes another look  and is horrified  the boy s face has been mutilated into a clown s mask  his mouth carved into a perpetual grin  the boy tells ursus that his name is gwynplaine    this is the only name he has ever known  the foundling girl  now sixteen years old  has been christened dea  latin for  goddess    dea is blind but beautiful and utterly virtuous  she is also in love with gwynplaine  as she is able to witness his kindly nature without seeing his hideous face  when dea attempts to  see  gwynplaine by passing her sightless fingers across his face  she assumes that he must always be happy because he is perpetually smiling  they fall in love  ursus and his two surrogate children earn a bare living in the fairs and carnivals of southern england  everywhere they travel  gwynplaine keeps the lower half of his face concealed  he is now the principal wage earner of their retinue    in each town they visit  gwynplaine gives a stage performance    the chief feature of this performance is that the crowds are invariably provoked to laughter when gwynplaine reveals his grotesque face  at one point  ursus and gwynplaine are readying for a performance when ursus directs gwynplaine s attention to a man who strides purposefully past their fairgrounds  dressed in ceremonial garments and bearing an elaborate wooden staff  ursus explains that this man is the wapentake  a servant of the crown    wapentake  is an old english word meaning  weapon touch    whomever the wapentake touches with his staff has been summoned by the monarch and must go to wherever the wapentake leads  upon pain of death  josiana attends one of gwynplaine s performances  and is sensually aroused by the combination of his virile grace and his facial deformity  gwynplaine  too  is aroused by josiana s physical beauty and haughty demeanor  suddenly  the wapentake arrives at the caravan and touches gwynplaine with his staff  compelling the disfigured man to follow him to the court of queen anne  gwynplaine is ushered to a dungeon in london  where a physician named hardquannone is being tortured to death  hardquannone recognizes the deformed gwynplaine  and identifies him as the boy whose abduction and disfigurement hardquannone arranged twenty three years earlier  in the year 1682  in the reign of james ii  one of the king s enemies was lord linnaeus clancharlie  marquis of corleone and a baron in the house of lords  who had remained faithful to the english republic and had emigrated to switzerland  upon the baron s death  the king arranged the abduction of his two year old son and legitimate heir   fermain  heir to his estates  the king sold fermain to a band of wanderers called  the comprachicos   david dirry moir is the illegitimate son of lord linnaeus  but now that fermain is known to be alive  the heritage once promised by the king to david on the condition of his future marriage to josiana will instead belong to fermain  the word  comprachicos  is hugo s invention  based on the spanish for  child buyers   they make their living by mutilating and disfiguring children  who are then forced to beg for alms  or who are exhibited as carnival freaks  on the king s command  the two year old fermain is sold to them and disfigured  it becomes clear that  after renaming fermain  gwynplaine  the comprachicos kept him in their possession until they abandoned him eight years later in 1690  on the night when he found dea  their ship was lost in the storm at sea  with all hands  but  in their repentance before death  they wrote out a signed confession and cast this adrift in a sealed flask  which now has belatedly come to the attention of queen anne  dea is saddened by gwynplaine s protracted absence  ursus and his band are falsely told that gwynplaine is now dead  dea has always been frail  but now she withers away even more  the authorities condemn them to exile for illegally using a wolf in their shows  gwynplaine accidentally meets josiana  having been brought into her palace by her confidant  the intriguer barkilphedro  at first she nearly seduces him  perversely excited by his deformity  however  she then receives a letter containing the queen s order to marry him  as a replacement for david and the legitimate lord clancharie  and therefore violently rejects him as a lover  while accepting him as her  formal  husband  gwynplaine is now formally instated as lord fermain clancharlie  marquis of corleone  in a grotesque scene  he is dressed in the elaborate robes and ceremonial wig of investiture  and commanded to take his seat in the house of lords  but  when the deformed gwynplaine addresses his peers with a fiery speech against the gross inequality of the age  the other lords are provoked to laughter by gwynplaine s clownish features  after the end of the session  david defends him and challenges a dozen lords to a duel  but then he also challenges gwynplaine to a duel for having chastised david s mother for having become the mistress of charles ii after having been the lover of his own father  lord linnaeus  gwynplaine renounces his peerage and returns to the caravan of ursus  and to the only family he has ever known  at first he cannot find them and nearly commits suicide out of grief  then he manages to find them and board their ship bound for the continent in the last minute  dea is delighted that gwynplaine has returned to her  she reveals her passion to gwynplaine  and then she abruptly dies  gwynplaine then walks  as though in a trance to the edge of the ship  speaking to dea  and with the reflection of a distant light in his eyes  though the sky is starless  he throws himself into the water  and is thus reunited with dea in death  when ursus  who has fainted in dea s last moments  comes to his senses  gwynplaine has vanished  and homo is staring mournfully over the ship s rail  howling into the sea from which gwynplaine will not return ,mystery

 this novel is episodic  with named chapters that often focus on a self contained incident  in this story  a gawky and seasick hornblower comes aboard his first ship  hms justinian  he immediately earns the contempt of the other midshipmen by  among other things  outshining them in their required mathematical studies  the young hornblower is particularly despised by a midshipman named simpson  simpson  at age thirty three  had failed his examination for lieutenant too many times to ever expect promotion and he took out his bitterness and disappointment on his juniors  he is said to be  diabolically clever at making other people s lives a burden to them   and hornblower  extremely unhappy already  is particularly affected and becomes suicidal  he takes the first opportunity for death presented to him by challenging simpson  a superior gunman  to a duel  hornblower finds that the most mathematically sound method for the duel is to take an  even chance  by having the duelists select from two pistols  only one of which has been loaded  and taking fire only a few feet apart  the captain secretly frustrates this by having the officers of the duel load neither weapon and by claiming a misfire when neither one shoots  following this  hornblower discovers the trick and angrily attempts to challenge the captain to a duel    the captain chides him that this is both an offence and a bad idea  the captain later has him transferred to the command of edward pellew on hms indefatigable after war is declared with france  in the cargo of rice  aboard the indefatigable  the newly situated midshipman hornblower is put in command of the french ship marie galante  carrying a cargo of rice from new orleans  by order of captain pellew after it is taken as a prize  it is hornblower s first time in command of a ship since joining the royal navy  he is instructed to take the captured french ship and her crew to a british port where he is to receive his next orders  sailing is relatively smooth for hornblower and his four seamen  until one of the crew  matthews  informs him that the ship is taking on water from somewhere  hornblower recalls that the marie galante was struck below the hull s waterline by a cannonball from the indefatigable before her capture  they check for moisture but find none until it is pointed out that the dried rice will absorb all of it  they hastily attempt to patch the hole with a sail  but by then the rice has expanded so much that the ship is breaking apart  a massive attempt to jettison the rice comes too late and hornblower commands all hands to abandon ship  hornblower s crew and the french prisoners are left at sea in an open boat  in the penalty of failure  hornblower and his crew are still out at sea  between british and french ports  the captain of the recently sunk marie galante pleads with hornblower to navigate to france and release him and his men  and promises safe passage for hornblower and his crew  hornblower promptly rejects the captain s pleading in spite of their bleak situation and uses his pistols to prevent a mutiny  not too long afterwards  hornblower and his crew are caught by a privateer named pique which was converted from a slave ship  this ship is commanded by captain neuville  hornblower is now a prisoner of war  but the indefatigable falls in with them and makes chase  as the pique is the faster sailer  hornblower devises a plan to slow her down   he sets a fire  which soon spreads to the very flammable paint locker  all hands are diverted to fighting the fire  which soon breaks out on the deck and spreads to the rigging  immediately slowing the vessel  the british ship ultimately overpowers the pique  extinguishes the fire and captain neuville and his crew surrender  hornblower s fears of reprimand for losing the maire galante are quickly extinguished by the offhanded dismissal of captain pellew  however  instead of taking credit for the fire  hornblower claims there was a spontaneous combustion in the paint locker  as way of punishing himself for losing the marie galante in the first place  upon returning to the indefatigable  hornblower is involved with a mission planned by captain pellew to take the french corvette papillon  hornblower is set to command the indefatigables jolly boat  his job in the raid is to board the papillon after the other boats do  climb the mast and loose the main topsail so the papillon can sail out to meet the indefatigable  before setting out  hornblower practises his task on the indefatigable to try and calm his nerves  while reviewing his men prior to shoving off  a man named hales mentions to hornblower that he feels  a bit queer like   after the boat crews depart  hales begins having a seizure  because of the necessity of silence  hornblower strikes hales with the tiller of his boat  on boarding the ship hornblower and his men are frustrated by the absence of a footrope along the yardarm  hornblower s fear of heights and poor balance cause him to freeze  until he reminds himself that he acted decisively enough when laying out hales    to withdraw now would be an act of extreme cowardice  motivated by this act of emotional self flagellation hornblower runs unaided along the yardarm and looses the topsail  during the fighting the jolly boat is lost  with hales still aboard  but the corvette papillon is taken as a prize of the indefatigable  hornblower feels bad about the loss of hales  without whom hornblower believes he would never have found the courage to complete his task  jackson claims that hales would have never made a decent seaman anyway  given the success of their mission hornblower realises the loss of the jolly boat will not be held against him  but still regrets the inevitable death of hales  when styles  a man in hornblower s division  appears strangely marked with  boils  all over his face  hornblower is suspicious  he gains a clue from finch  another of his men  who

 the story takes place in the backdrop of trantor s rise from a large regional power to a galaxy wide empire  unifying millions of worlds  this story occurs around the year 11 000 ad  originally 34 500 ad  according to asimov s early 1950s chronology   when the trantorian empire encompasses roughly half of the galaxy  the independent planet sark exploits the planet florina and derives its great wealth from  kyrt   a versatile and fluorescent fiber that can only be grown on florina  the relationship between the two planets is analogous to the situation between european imperial powers and their colonies during the 19th century  where the florinians are forced to work in kyrt fields and are treated as an inferior race by the sarkites  attempts to break the sark monopoly and grow kyrt on other worlds have thus far been unsuccessful  meanwhile  trantor would like to add these two worlds to its growing empire  there is a hidden irony in sark s dominion over florina   clear parallels to the american south growing cotton with slave labor  the florinians are one of the lightest skinned people in a galaxy where racial categories seem to have been forgotten  except by the people of sark  one of the characters  dr  selim junz  comes from libair  a planet with some of the galaxy s darkest skinned people  and feels sympathy for the florinians   the planet libair takes its name from liberia  a country in africa  which would explain a dark skinned genetic inheritance  liberia was also settled by freed slaves from america   also  asimov chose the name of  kyrt  to be rather similar to  cotton   and he explains that it contains cellulose  the possible destruction of florina is predicted by rik  a  spatio analyst   who has had his mind manipulated by a  psychic probe  device  resulting in gross amnesia  when rik gradually starts remembering his past  it produces a political crisis involving sark  florina  and trantor  rik  a native of the earth  had discovered that florina s sun is about to explode into a nova because it is being fed carbon by one of the outer space  currents of space   supposedly rather like the currents of the ocean  it is also revealed at long last that the special energetic wavelength of light that is being emitted by florina s sun is what causes the very high quality kyrt fiber to grow there  this is the explanation why kyrt cannot be grown on other planets    since stars going nova are really quite rare  and stars with habitable planets that go nova are rarer still  because losing florina would mean losing the only source of its vast wealth  there is strong resistance from sark to accept the message  however  when it is explained that the wealth is already lost since the conditions that enable kyrt to grow can be easily duplicated anywhere now that they are understood  they become more amenable  when trantor offers to buy out the entire planet for a very high price  the offer is readily accepted  even though there is not yet a full galactic empire  trantor does control the now largely radioactive earth  the idea of evacuating earth is mentioned  but that is strongly rejected by rik  he insists that it is the original planet of the human race  though this is not generally accepted ,fantasy

 in the previous novel  2010   odyssey two  jupiter was converted into a mini sun which was dubbed  lucifer  following the soviet ship leonov  s mission to jupiter to find out what happened to the discovery  a message was sent to earth by dave bowman  through hal   this is due to lucifer melting the frozen ocean beneath the surface of europa  causing an atmosphere to form and leading to the discovery of alien life in europa s ocean  when the leonov returned to earth  heywood floyd  whose marriage had broken up while he was on the leonov  suffered an accident  his recovery on an orbital space hospital took longer than expected and he became a permanent resident there after finding that his body could no longer handle earth level gravity  his grandson chris works aboard the spacecraft galaxy and has not seen his grandfather in years  the black population of south africa has rebelled in the 2030s and formed the united states of southern africa  ussa   the white population fled to europe  taking most of the country s wealth with them and leaving the black population to rebuild the economy  which they did in a matter of weeks by use of diamonds   2061 was published in 1987  at which time apartheid was still in force in south africa   large scale interplanetary travel is now commercially viable with muon catalyzed fusion powered spacecraft  on europa  an enormous mountain has sprung up out of nowhere  no one is sure of the origin of  mount zeus     being asymmetrical  it cannot be a volcano  in 2061  at the age of 103  floyd is chosen as one of several  celebrity guests  to come aboard the privately owned spaceliner universe for the first ever human landing on the surface of halley s comet  when it makes its periodic pass through the solar system  meanwhile  a team of scientists on ganymede  formerly a moon of jupiter that now orbits the star called  lucifer   is terraforming it for potential habitation  scientist rolf van der berg  a second generation afrikaner refugee  studies pictures of mount zeus and determines that it is in fact one enormous diamond  he communicates his discovery to his uncle paul kreuger    the expedition planners invite van der berg to join the crew of galaxy for its flyby of europa  as galaxy nears europa  a stewardess attempts to single handedly hijack galaxy  forcing it to crash into europa s ocean  her plan having failed  her motivation and loyalties are not explained  but she is assumed to be a militant anti afrikaner   she commits suicide  the crew is now stranded  but their sister ship universe is tasked to rescue her  van der berg and chris floyd take the shuttle william tsung  nicknamed bill tee  to study mount zeus    also the wreck of the chinese spacecraft tsien  and the enormous monolith lying on its side at the border between the dayside and nightside  dubbed the  great wall   near mount zeus  van der berg relays the message  lucy is here  to his uncle paul  verifying that mount zeus is indeed one large diamond  the code word  lucy  was chosen both in reference to the mini sun lucifer and to an article in the journal nature in 1981 hypothesizing that the cores of uranus and neptune were in fact diamonds the size of earth  caused by the compression of carbon   with the hypothesis making a logical extension to jupiter  the article was subtitled  diamonds in the sky   in reference to the beatles song  lucy in the sky with diamonds   mount zeus is a fragment of jupiter s core which survived the creation of lucifer and later struck europa  on the universe  the celebrity guests discuss the mystery surrounding bowman and the monoliths  and whether they would be allowed to land on europa to rescue galaxy  s crew  floyd follows a suggestion that he simply try to call bowman on the radio  and that night has a strange dream in which he sees the monolith floating at the foot of his bed  the bill tee flies by tsien  which has been completely stripped of its metals  rare and thus valuable to the europans   and on to the great wall  an image of his grandfather appears to chris in the same way that bowman appeared to floyd in 2010  telling him that the universe was coming  universe rescues galaxys crew    they are brought to ganymede  where they watch as mount zeus  which has been steadily sinking  finally disappears beneath the europan surface  kreuger writes a follow up article for nature  stating that mount zeus was a mere fragment of jupiter s core and it is almost certain that many more such large pieces of diamond are currently in orbit around lucifer  and proposing that a program be initiated immediately to collect these enormous quantities of diamond and put them to use  floyd and chris become close again  and both become friends with van der berg  they talk about how floyd called bowman on the radio  and chris asks if bowman ever replied  floyd almost tells his grandson about the monolith in his cabin  but does not after rationalizing that it was probably a dream  it was not a dream  the monolith duplicated floyd s consciousness    there are now two heywood floyds  one an immortal being who resides with bowman and hal inside the great wall  in the epilogue  the star lucifer stops shining in 3001  and in manhattan  the monolith awakes   referring to the original monolith discovered on the moon in 1999  and which was taken to manhattan as a monument in 2006   it is also indicated that humans have found more quantities of diamond from the former jupiter and used it to create space elevators and an orbital ring connecting them  as suggested by kreuger   this idea will later be a central concept in 3001   the final odyssey  ,fantasy
 this novel begins with a brief prologue describing the aliens who created the black monoliths  they apparently evolved from  primordial soup   and over the course of millions of years  turned into a space faring species  as they explored the universe  they saw that few intelligent species ever successfully evolved  therefore  they traveled the universe and catalyzed the evolution of intelligent species wherever they went  including earth  by increasing the evolving species  odds of survival  upon reaching earth  they performed experiments on many species to encourage the development of intelligence  then they left  leaving their black monoliths behind  after visiting the earth  the extraterrestrials continued to evolve  eventually to the point where they found a way to impress themselves into the fabric of space and time  thus becoming noncorporeal beings  meanwhile  back in the solar system  the alien monoliths continued to watch over humanity  however  sometimes the monoliths were prone to degenerating and acting independently of their original programming  3001 follows the adventures of frank poole  the astronaut who was killed by the hal 9000 computer in 2001   a space odyssey by tearing his spacesuit open and casting him on a trajectory into deep space  one thousand years later  poole s freeze dried body is discovered out in the kuiper belt beyond the orbit of neptune by a human spaceship  a comet collecting space tug named the goliath  the advanced medical science and technology of that age is able to bring poole back to life  being freeze dried and then kept near absolute zero for the intervening centuries preserved poole s body and brain well enough for him to make a full recovery  poole is next taken home to explore and learn about the earth in the year 3001  a millennium after he left it  some of its notable features include the braincap  a brain computer interface technology that connects a computer directly to the human brain  genetically engineered dinosaur servants  a space drive  and four gigantic space elevators spaced evenly around the equator  human beings have also colonized the jovian moons ganymede and callisto  during the 26th century  the remains of an alien monolith has been found in the olduvai gorge in east africa  the one that had that kickstarted human evolution   tma 1  the black monolith that had been found on the moon in 1999  was brought to the earth in 2006 and then erected in front of the united nations building in new york city  in the course of the novel  it is determined that following the events of 2010   odyssey two and 2061   odyssey three the jovian monolith had sent a report back to its makers some 450 light years away  it is expected to receive its orders on how to deal with humanity after the 900 year round trip  presumably  the monolith was empowered to obliterate the nascent biosphere of jupiter  but it needed a higher authority s approval to obliterate the technological civilization on earth  there is considerable worry that the judgment  which was based on the monolith s observations of humanity up to 2061  will be negative  the entire human race  then  may be in danger of being obliterated by the aliens  just as the jovian life forms discovered by david bowman were deliberately destroyed in the course of making jupiter into a second sun so the europans could evolve  frank manages to conscript bowman and hal  who had fused into a new entity    halman    and now reside in the monolith s computational matrix  to infect the monolith with a computer virus retrieved from pico vault  a special containment facility on the moon used to house various chemical  biological  and cybernetic weapons in an attempt to avert a potential apocalypse  just as the humans feared  the monolith does indeed receive orders to exterminate humankind  and it begins to duplicate itself many hundreds of millions of times over  these millions of monoliths assemble themselves into two separate screens in front of the sun to prevent all light and heat from reaching the earth and its colonies  the intent is to shut down the entire terrestrial biosphere  however  halman had already infected the monolith with the virus at the time it began duplicating itself  and fifteen minutes after the screens are formed  all the monoliths disintegrate  including tma 0 and tma 1  halman manages to upload its combined personalities into a petabyte capacity holographic 3d storage medium and thus survives the disintegration of the monoliths  however  that medium is infected with the virus in the process and is subsequently sealed by human scientists in pico vault  where it will presumably be stored until such time as humans  or others  choose to disinfect and revive it  at the close of the story  poole and the other humans land on europa and attempt to start peaceful relations with the primitive native europans  apparently  the creators of the monoliths   having long since evolved into a noncorporeal and godlike state of existence   had been watching humanity  they decide to grant the human race a reprieve  and that they will not determine humanity s fate until  the last days  ,fantasy

some information  most of it useless in finding out who runs the racket  they kick him out of the store  believing him to be just a small time hood  archie protests jedson s tactics  but jedson replies that he didn t really do anything  the circle and the doll were just symbolic  it was the man s own misguided beliefs which caused his body to react as if he really were being imprisoned and

site  then after some activity in the tent  announces he can do nothing and that they owe him  500 as a  survey fee   jedson politely tells him to forget it  as no such fee was mentioned before  and magicians  like lawyers  work on a  contingency fee  basis  biddle disappears in a huff  at that point a young magician by the name of bodie  who had been watching the performance  tells then they should have used an old witch he knows  a mrs  jennings  they consult her in her small  well ordered home  after a reading of tea leaves  her usual line of work  she announces that she knows what they need and they all move to archie s business  there  with archie and jedson in the tent  she draws a pentacle and calls the elementals to her  these are a gnome  an undine  and a fire salamander  the undine is a repulsive sluglike creature  while the salamander is a naive  benign creature of flame which sees no wrong in burning  though it regrets causing harm  by force and persuasion  she instructs them to reverse what they did  there is a huge rushing noise and archie s business is restored  strange events continue  this time directed at archie himself  a few times he is saved from

 the story begins with jessie burlingame and her husband gerald in the bedroom of their secluded cabin in western maine  where they have gone for an off beat romantic weekend  gerald  a successful lawyer with an aggressive personality  has been able to reinvigorate the couple s sex life by handcuffing jessie to the bed  jessie has been into the game before  but suddenly balks  as gerald starts to crawl on top of her  knowing her protests are real but ignoring them anyway  she kicks him in the stomach and in the groin  and he then has a heart attack  falls from the bed to the floor  cracks his head  and dies  jessie is alone in the cabin and unable to move or summon help  the only things that show up are a hungry stray dog named prince that starts feeding on gerald s body and a terrifying  deformed apparition that may or may not be real  whom jessie first mistakes for the ghost of her long dead father but dismisses it later  jessie begins to think of this bizarre visitor as  the space cowboy   after a line from a steve miller song   the joker    a combination of panic and thirst eventually causes jessie to hallucinate  she hears voices in her head  each one ostensibly the voice of a person in her life  primarily  the goodwife  or  goody burlingame   a somewhat puritanical version of jessie   ruth neary  an old college friend   and nora callighan  her ex psychiatrist   both of whom jessie hasn t spoken to in decades  these voices represent different parts of her personality which help her extract a painful childhood memory she has kept suppressed for many years  she was sexually abused by her father at age ten during a solar eclipse that occurred in her maine hometown  she also begins to realize how unhappy her marriage was  and that she sacrificed the life she wanted for the security of gerald s paycheck by being a trophy wife without children  this internal dialogue is mixed with descriptions of jessie s more and more desperate attempts to get out of the handcuffs  first by trying to break the headboard she was cuffed to then by trying to slip off the bed and push the bed to the bureau where the keys were placed  finally she does escape after one of the voices in her head tells her that if she stays another night  the space cowboy  who she dreamed of as a manifestation of death  will more than likely take a part of her to add to its trophy  fishing creel  filled with jewelry and human bones  killing her in the process  jessie escapes the handcuffs by slicing her arm open all the way around on a broken glass and giving herself a degloving injury in order to lubricate her skin enough for the cuffs  which were made for men and not women and thus almost loose enough for her to slip out normally  to slide off her right hand  she is then able to move behind the bed  push it over to the bureau and use one of the keys to unlock her left handcuff  however  she has lost a lot of blood and passes out shortly after  when she awakens  it is now nighttime  and the space cowboy has made his way back into the house  jessie confronts him and throws her wedding ring at his box of jewelry and bones  thinking that is what he wanted all along  then turns and runs out of the house  she is able to make it into her car and finally escape the house  but is terrified to discover the space cowboy sitting in the backseat of the car  jessie crashes out of fear and is knocked unconscious  and it is later revealed that she only imagined the space cowboy in the backseat  the story cuts to months later with jessie recuperating from the incident and being looked after by a nurse  an ambitious associate attorney at gerald s law firm assists her in covering up the real incident to protect her and the law firm from scandal  as well as assisting her in her recuperation  at the end  we get to read the letter that jessie writes to ruth neary  detailing what happened after the incident and her recuperation process  which is slow but very meaningful  one of the passages in the letter revolves around a serial necrophiliac and murderer named raymond andrew joubert making his way through maine    it turns out he was the space cowboy  confirmed when jessie confronted him in a court hearing and joubert mimicked jessie s arm positions while she was in the handcuffs  he also repeated her frightened exclamations that joubert was  not anyone   and that he was only  made of moonlight   jessie also mentions what became of prince who gnawed on gerald  he is shot and killed  initially  his owner had abandoned him in maine and driven back to massachusetts  simply because he didn t want to pay for the dog s license  the only true supernatural event in the story occurs as described during one of jessie s flashbacks  when  during a particularly stressful incident at the time of childhood  she has a waking dream  in king s subsequent novel  dolores claiborne  it is revealed that the title main character shared a telepathic connection with jessie burlingame on two occasions  first during the solar eclipse when jessie was assaulted by her father  and later when she is handcuffed to the bed  the two novels were initially conceived to be part of a single volume titled in the path of the eclipse  later editions of dolores claiborne have a foreword that explains the connection between the two  sheriff alan pangborn and deputy norris ridgewick are mentioned near the end of gerald s game  both characters appeared previously in the dark half and needful things  set in the fictional town of castle rock  in the later

 the book begins with the historical  failed attempt on de gaulle s life planned by col  jean marie bastien thiry in the paris suburb of petit clamart  after bastien thiry s arrest  the french security forces wage a short but extremely vicious  underground  war with the terrorists of the oas  a militant right wing group who have labeled de gaulle a traitor to france after his grant of independence to algeria  the french secret service  a k a  action service  is remarkably effective in infiltrating the terrorist organization with their own informants  allowing them to kidnap and neutralize the terrorists  chief of operations  antoine argoud  the failure of the petit clamart assassination  and a subsequent attempt at the ecole militaire  coupled with bastien thiry s eventual execution by firing squad  likewise cripples the morale of the terrorists  argoud s deputy  lt  col  marc rodin  carefully examines their few remaining options and determines that the only way to succeed in killing de gaulle is to hire a professional assassin from outside the organization  someone completely unknown to either the french authorities or the oas itself  after inquiries  he contacts an englishman  whose name is never given   who meets with rodin and his two principal deputies in vienna  and agrees to assassinate de gaulle for the sum of  500 000  about  2 4 million in 2012   the four men agree on his code name   the jackal   the remainder of part one describes the jackal s exhaustive preparations for the assassination  first  he acquires a legitimate british passport under a false name  under which he plans to operate for the majority of his mission  he also steals the passports of two foreign tourists visiting london who superficially resemble the jackal  for use in an emergency  using his primary false passport  the jackal travels to belgium  where he commissions a specialized sniper rifle of great slimness and an appropriate silencer from a master gunsmith  and a set of forged french identity papers from a master forger  when picking up his fake identity papers  the master forger attempts to blackmail the jackal but the jackal kills him and locks the body in a large trunk inside the forger s house  where he correctly deduces it won t be found for a long time  after exhaustively researching a series of books and articles by  and about  de gaulle  the jackal travels to paris to reconnoiter the most favorable spot and the most likely day for the assassination  after orchestrating a series of armed robberies in france  the oas is able to deposit the first half of the jackal s fee in his bank in switzerland  at the same time  the french secret service  curious about the actions of rodin and his subordinates  fake a letter that lures one of rodin s bodyguards to france  where he is captured and interrogated  before dying  interpreting his incoherent ramblings  the secret service is able to piece together rodin s plot  but without knowing the name or the exact description of the assassin  when told about the plot  de gaulle  who was notoriously careless of his personal safety  refuses  absolutely  to cancel his public appearances  modify his normal routines  or even allow any kind of public inquiry into the assassin s whereabouts to be made  any inquiry  he orders  must be done in absolute secrecy  roger frey  the french minister of the interior  convenes a meeting of the heads of the french security forces  since rodin and his men have taken refuge at a hotel in rome under heavy guard  they cannot be captured and interrogated  the rest of the meeting is at a loss to suggest how to proceed  except a commissioner of the police judiciare  who reasons that their first and most essential step is to establish the jackal s identity  which is a job for a detective  when asked to name the best detective in france  he volunteers his own deputy commissioner  claude lebel  granted special emergency powers to conduct his investigation  lebel does everything he can to discover the jackal s identity  he first calls upon his  old boy network  of foreign intelligence and police contacts to inquire if they have any records of a top class political assassin  most of the inquiries are fruitless  but in the united kingdom  the inquiry is eventually passed on to the special branch of scotland yard  and another veteran detective  superintendent bryn thomas  a search through special branch s records turns up nothing  however one of thomas s subordinates suggests that if the assassin was an englishman  but primarily operated abroad  he d be more likely to come to the attention of the secret intelligence service  thomas makes an informal inquiry with a friend of his on the sis s staff  who mentions hearing a rumor from an officer stationed in the dominican republic at the time of president trujillo s assassination  the rumor states that a hired assassin stopped trujillo s car with a rifle shot  allowing a gang of partisans to finish him off    and moreover  that the assassin was an englishman  named charles calthrop  to his surprise  thomas is summoned in person by the prime minister  unnamed  but likely intended to represent harold macmillan   who informs him that word of his inquiries has reached higher circles in the british government  despite the enmity felt by much of the government against france in general and de gaulle in particular  the prime minister informs thomas that de gaulle is his friend  and that the assassin must be identified and stopped at all costs  thomas is handed a commission much similar to lebel s  with temporary powers allowing him to override almost any other authority in the land  checking out the name of charles calthrop  thomas finds a match to a man living in london  said to be on holiday in scotland  while thomas confirms that this calthrop was in the dominican republic at the time of trujillo s death  he does not feel it is enough to inform lebel  but then one of his junior detectives realizes that the first three letters of his christian name and surname form the french  and spanish  word for jackal  chacal  thomas calls lebel immediately  unknown to any member of the council in france  the mistress of one of them  an arrogant air force colonel attached to de gaulle s staff  is actually an oas agent  through pillow talk  the colonel unwittingly feeds the jackal a constant stream of information as to lebel s progress  the jackal enters france by way of italy  driving a rented alfa romeo sports car with his special gun hidden in the chassis  on receiving word from the oas agent that the french are on the lookout for him  he decides his plan will succeed nevertheless  and forges ahead  in london  the special branch raids calthrop s flat  finding his passport  and deduce that he must be travelling on a false one  when they work out the name of the jackal s primary false identity  lebel and the police come close to apprehending the jackal in the south of france  but thanks to his oas contact  the jackal checks out of his hotel early and evades them by only an hour  with the police on the lookout for him  the jackal takes refuge in the chateau of a woman whom he seduced while she was staying at the hotel the night before  when she goes through his things and finds the gun  he kills her and escapes again  the murder is not reported until much later that evening  allowing the jackal to assume one of his two emergency identities and board the train for paris  lebel becomes suspicious of what the rest of the council label the jackal s  good luck   and has the telephones of all the members wiretapped  which leads him to discover the oas agent  the air force colonel withdraws from

 on new year s eve 1986  professional thief jim rawlings breaks into the apartment of a senior civil servant  and unintentionally discovers stolen top secret documents  although one of the most notorious crooks in london  he is enough of a patriot to send the documents  anonymously  to mi5 so that they might find the traitor  in moscow  the british traitor kim philby drafts a memorandum for the general secretary  soviet president  stating that  if the labour party wins the next general election in the uk  scheduled for sometime in the subsequent eighteen months   the  hard left  of the party will oust the moderate  populist neil kinnock in favour of a radical new leader who will adopt a true marxist leninist manifesto  including the expulsion of all american forces from england and the country s withdrawal from and repudiation of the north atlantic treaty organization  nato   in conjunction with a gru general  an academic named krilov and a master strategist  philby devises  plan aurora  to ensure a labour victory by exploiting the party s support for unilateral disarmament  although it is noted that krilov has come up with most of the plan s strategy  mi5 officer john preston  who was exploring hard left infiltration of the labour party  investigates the stolen documents and finds that they were leaked by george berenson  a passionate anti communist and supporter of south africa  berenson passed on the documents to jan marais  a man he believes is a south african diplomat  but is in fact a russian false flag agent  sis chief sir nigel irvine confronts berenson with the truth and  turns him   using him to pass disinformation to the kgb  preston is being pushed towards retirement by a his mi5 superior  but is worried about his retirement finances  wanting custody of his son  as part of plan aurora  russian agent valeri petrofsky arrives under deep cover in england and sets up home in ipswich  from there  he travels around the country collecting packages from various couriers who have smuggled them into the country as harmless looking artefacts  one of the couriers  disguised as a sailor  is attacked by neds in glasgow and taken to hospital  where he commits suicide rather than submit to questioning  preston investigates and finds three out of place looking metal discs in a tobacco tin in his gunny sack  he shows the discs to a metallurgist who identifies the outer two as aluminum but the other as polonium  a key element in the initiator of an atomic bomb  preston reports his findings to his mi5 superior  who ignores them and has preston taken off the politically embarrassing case  sir nigel irvine  however  suspects that a major intelligence operation is under way  and has preston work unofficially for him to search for other russian couriers  at the same time  he uses berenson to pass a deliberate piece of disinformation to the kgb  in moscow  the director of operations for the kgb  general karpov  discovers aurora s existence  he identifies that the general secretary is responsible  and blackmails krilov into revealing the plan    in contravention of the fourth protocol to the 1968 nuclear non proliferation treaty a small atomic device is to be smuggled  via its component parts  into england  and be exploded near bentwaters air force base a week before the general election  evidence will be left that the explosion was an accidental detonation of an american weapon  leading to a wave of anti americanism  support for unilateral disarmament and for the only major party committed to disarmament  the labour party  the day after they win the election  the hard left will take over and begin to dismantle the western alliance in europe  meanwhile  preston tries in vain to uncover other couriers connected to the operation  a month into the investigation  a bumbling czech agent under the name franz winkler arrives at heathrow with a forged passport and is followed to a house in chesterfield  preston s patience is rewarded when petrofsky shows up to use the radio transmitter that is located there  he trails petrofsky to his rented house  where the bomb has been assembled  an sas team is called in to storm the house  and manage to wound petrofsky before he can detonate the bomb  against preston s express wishes  the leader of the sas team shoots the russian agent in the head afterwards  before dying petrofsky manages to say one last word     philby    preston confronts sir nigel irvine with his theory that the operation was deliberately blown by philby  philby did not know petrofksy s location but instead  sent franz winkler  with an obviously forged passport  to the location of the transmitter  and ultimately  to petrofsky  sir nigel admits to sabotaging the kgb s british operation by leaking disinformation through berenson to general karpov  that they were closing in on their suspect  in turn  karpov  and not philby  sent winkler  sabotaging plan aurora  by sending winkler  karpov is thwarting a british publicity victory as sir nigel understood the implication  that petrofsky must not be taken alive or exposed in the media  at the novel s end  preston s mi5 superior and adversary is denied a senior leadership role due to his misjudgment in the case and subsequently resigns from mi5 altogether  preston also resigns  but through sir nigel irvine  finds lucrative private sector employment that enables him to obtain full custody of his son  marais is taken into custody by south african intelligence and berenson s work is left unusable to the kgb  as sir nigel  using his own spy network  intends to plant the suspicion that berenson was in fact a double agent  and so his information will be considered suspect ,thriler

lamare for  showing him a cold shoulder  when he made a pass at her  one friday morning soon afterwards  lamare s body is found on the floor of john robertson s workplace at the studio  which happens to be a state of the art cutting room  the place is equipped with an automatic camera which  once it has been set  starts recording the moment the door to the room is opened  estella lamare has died from stab wounds  and although the roll of film showing her slow death can be found it cannot be decided exactly how she died  on the film ian jensen  her partner in her last movie  from which she was to be cut out   can be seen struggling with lamare  but the cause of her death may have been either an accident or suicide  or murder  as jensen is nowhere to be found scotland yard assumes that he is lamare s murderer and that he has escaped to his native norway  however  four days later  on december 3  1935  his body is found in a shabby rented room in a cheap boarding house in london  jensen has been poisoned and  at a point in time when he was already dead  shot in the head  the police investigations are conducted by detective inspector smith of scotland yard  right from the start there is antagonism between smith and mccabe   each suspects the other of knowing more about the case than he admits  with mc cabe repeatedly assuming the role of detective while smith seemingly has no idea how to solve the crime  eventually the confrontation between the two antagonists escalates mdash   their  game  turns into a  fight  mdash   when smith has mccabe arrested for the murder of ian jensen  mccabe refuses to be represented by a lawyer during his trial   a layman conducting his own defence    and systematically tries to break down the case against his person and to win over the jury to his cause  in the course of the trial a number of facts about the people involved in the two deaths are revealed  for example  we learn that mccabe himself is a  morally uprooted  man who has replaced  eternal values  with  values of the moment   until his arrest he has a relationship with maria ray  the actress who  together with lamare and jensen  forms the love triangle in the recently completed film  although maria ray is the love of his life  mccabe cannot help starting an affair with dinah lee  his secretary  and  by carrying on two relationships at the same time  double crossing both women  in his defence he even goes so far as to use ray s own promiscuity mdash   she has had affairs with both mccabe and jensen mdash   to question her credibility as a witness for the prosecution  he also insinuates that smith has used doctored evidence to build up his case against him  the members of the jury are impressed  pronounce a verdict of  not guilty   and mccabe is acquitted  smith now turns out to be a policeman who cannot lose but who actually loses his job as a result of mccabe s acquittal  when mccabe eventually tells him that he is jensen s murderer after all it is because he realizes that he has irrevocably lost maria  as well as dinah   who would not even speak to him on the phone  and that there is not anything left in this world that might keep him alive  now that he has written his story down for posterity he no longer minds being the target of smith s revenge  who thinks mccabe s belated confession is the last straw  mccabe posts his manuscript to an old journalist called a b c  m  ller whose acquaintance he has recently made and immediately afterwards is found shot  smith is arrested  tried  and hanged  with cameron mccabe dead  the addressee of his manuscript continues the narrative  a part of the book which is entitled  an epilogue by a b c  m  ller as epitaph for cameron mccabe   m  ller sees to the proof reading and the publication of the face on the cutting room floor and becomes an avid collector of reviews of the book  comparing it with the fiction of hemingway  dashiell hammett  and even james joyce  at the same time he deplores  and condemns  the  arrested development of the criminal mind   in particular of course mccabe s  one day in london m  ller bumps into maria ray  whom he has not seen again since the trial  and they have a talk  to m  ller s surprise  she claims that mccabe committed suicide mdash   as an act of revenge  in order to get smith convicted for murder  she also tells m  ller that smith was in love

attempts to follow his brother  one night he hides in a cave  and later  two of tengil s men wait outside it to meet the traitor  who turns out to be jossi the tavernkeeper and not hubert  as karl had

from a near eternal sleep and entered his castle  the next day the brothers cross the river  using the suspension bridge that connects the thorn rose valley from karmanjaka  the entrance to the katla cave is guarded by tengil s soldiers  but jonatan manages to find a second entrance  deep in the mountain they arrive at the katla cave where orvar is kept  they manage to release orvar from his

himself into a small boat  but the current catches him and takes him to certain death in the waterfall  upon which karl cannot resist crying despite his treason  shortly thereafter  the people of the thorn rose valley rise up against tengil and his men  and jonatan reluctantly agrees to join the fighting despite his pledge never to take a life  even if it ment the loss of his own  orvar mocks him

 ada tells the life story of a man named van veen  and his lifelong love affair with his sister ada  they meet when she is eleven  soon to be twelve  and he is fourteen  believing that they are cousins  more precisely   that their fathers are cousins and that their mothers are sisters   and begin a sexual affair  they later discover that van s father is also ada s and her mother is also his  the story follows the various interruptions and resumptions of their affair  both are wealthy  educated  and intelligent  van goes on to become a world renowned psychologist  and the book itself takes the form of his memoirs  written when he is in his nineties  punctuated with his own and ada s marginal notes  and in parts with notes by an unnamed editor  suggesting the manuscript is not complete  the novel is divided into five parts  each approximately half the length of the preceding one  as they progress chronologically  this structure evokes a sense of a person reflecting on his own memories  with an adolescence stretching out epically  and many later years simply flashing by  the story takes place in the late nineteenth century on what appears to be an alternative history of earth  which is there called demonia or antiterra  antiterra has the same geography and a largely similar history to that of earth    however  it is crucially different at various points  for example  the united states includes all of the americas  which were discovered by african navigators   but it was also settled extensively by russians  so that what we know as western canada is a russian speaking province called  estoty   and eastern canada a french speaking province called  canady   russian  english  and french are all in use in north america  russia itself  and much of asia  is part of an empire called tartary  while the word  russia  is simply a  quaint synonym  for estoty  the british empire  which includes most or all of europe and africa  is ruled  in the nineteenth century   by a king victor  aristocracy is still widespread  but some technology has advanced well into twentieth century forms  electricity  however  has been banned since almost the time of its discovery following an event referred to as  the l disaster   airplanes and cars exist  but television and telephones do not  their functions served by similar devices powered by water  the setting is thus a complex mixture of russia and america in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries  the belief in a  twin  world  terra  is widespread on antiterra as a sort of fringe religion or mass hallucination   the name  antiterra  may be a back formation from this    the planet is  really  called  demonia    one of van s early specialties as a psychologist is researching and working with people who believe that they are somehow in contact with terra  terra s alleged history  so far as he states it  appears to be that of our world   that is  the characters in the novel dream  or hallucinate  about the real world  the central characters are all members of the north american aristocracy  of mostly russian and irish descent  dementiy   demon   veen is first cousins with daniel veen  they marry a pair of twin sisters  aqua and marina respectively  who are also their second cousins  demon and aqua raise a son  ivan  van     dan and marina two daughters  ada and lucette  the story begins when van  aged 14  spends a summer with his cousins  then 12 and 8  a rough idea of the years covered by each section is provided in brackets  below  but the narrator s thoughts often stray outside of the periods noted  this part  which one critic called  the last 19th century russian novel   takes up nearly half the book  throughout this part of the novel  the many passages depicting the blossoming of van and ada s love vary in rhythm  in style  and in vocabulary  ranging from lustrous  deceptively simple yet richly sensual prose to leering and baroque satire of eighteenth century pornography  depending on the mood nabokov wishes to convey  the first four chapters provide a sort of unofficial prologue  in that they move swiftly back and forth through the chronology of the narrative  but mostly deal with events between 1863 and 1884  when the main thrust of the story commences  they depict van and ada discovering their true relationship  demon and marina s tempestuous affair  marina s sister aqua s descent into madness and obsession with terra and water  and van s  first love   a girl he sees in an antique shop but never speaks to  some readers regard these first four chapters as being deliberately difficult  chapters 4 to 43 mostly deal with van s adolescence  and his first meetings with his  cousin  ada  focused on the two summers when he joins her  and her  sister  lucette  at ardis hall  their ancestral home  in 1884 and 1888  in 1884 van and ada  age 14 and 12  fall passionately in love  and their affair is marked by a powerful sense of romantic eroticism  the book opens with their discovery that they are in fact not cousins but brother and sister  the passage is notoriously difficult  more so as neither of them explicitly states the conclusion they have drawn  treating it as obvious   and it is only referred to in passing later in the text  although ada s mother keeps a wedding photo dated august 1871  eleven months before her birth  they find in a box in the attic a newspaper announcement dating the wedding to december 1871    and furthermore that dan had been abroad since that spring  as proved by his extensive filmreels  hence he is not ada s father  furthermore they find an annotated flower album kept by marina in 1869  70 which indicate  very obliquely  that she was pregnant and confined to a sanatorium at the same time as aqua    that 99 orchids were delivered to marina  from demon  on van s birthday    and that aqua had a miscarriage in a skiing accident  it later transpires that marina gave the child to her sister to replace the one she had lost  so she is in fact van s mother  and that her affair with demon continued until ada s conception  this makes lucette  dan and marina s child  the uterine half sister of both of them  van returns to ardis for a second visit in the summer of 1888  the affair has become strained because of van s suspicions that ada has had another lover and the increasing intrusion of lucette  their 12 year old half sister  into their trysts  an intrusion that van half welcomes but ada resents   this section ends with van s discovery that ada has in fact been unfaithful and his flight from ardis to exact revenge upon those  rivals  of whom he is aware  phillip rack  ada s older and weak charactered music teacher    and percy de prey  a rather boorish neighbour  van is distracted by a chance altercation with a soldier named tapper  whom he challenges to a duel and by whom he is wounded  in hospital he chances upon phillip rack  who is dying  and whom van cannot bring himself to exact revenge upon  he then receives word that percy de prey has been shot and killed in antiterra s version of the ongoing crimean war  van moves to live with cordula de prey  percy s cousin  in her manhattan apartment  whilst he fully recovers  they have a shallow physical relationship  which provides van with respite from the emotional strain of his feelings for ada  van spends his time developing his studies in psychology  and visiting a number of the  villa venus  upper class brothels  in the autumn of 1892 lucette  now having declared her love for van  brings him a letter from ada in which she announces she has received an offer of marriage from a wealthy russian  andrey vinelander  should van wish to invite her to live with him she will refuse the offer  van does so  and they commence living together in an apartment van has purchased from ada s old school friend  and van s former lover  cordula de prey  in february 1893 their father  demon  arrives with news that his cousin  ada s supposed father  but actual stepfather  dan has died following a period of exposure caused by running naked into the woods near his home during a terrifying hallucinatory episode  upon grasping the situation regarding van and ada  he tells van that ada would be happier if he  gave her up   and what is more  he would disown van completely if he failed to do so  van acquiesces  leaves  and attempts suicide  which fails when his gun fails to fire  he then leaves his manhattan apartment and preoccupies himself with hunting down a former servant at ardis  kim beauharnais  who had been blackmailing them with photographic evidence of their affair  and beating him with an alpenstock until he is blind  with ada having married andrey vinelander  van occupies himself in traveling and his studies  until 1901 when lucette reappears in england  she has herself booked on the same transatlantic ship  the tobakoff  that van is taking back to america  she attempts to seduce him on the crossing and nearly succeeds  but is foiled when ada appears as an actress in the film  don juan s last fling  that they are watching together on the onboard cinema  lucette consumes a number of sleeping pills and commits suicide by throwing herself from the tobakoff into the atlantic  in march 1905  demon dies in a plane crash  later in 1905  ada and andrey arrive in switzerland as part of a party engaged in uncovering lucette s fortune  concealed in various hidden bank accounts  van meets with them  and together he and ada formulate a plan for her to leave her husband and live with him  this is now considered possible due to the death of demon  during their stay in switzerland  however  andrey falls ill with tuberculosis  and ada decides that she cannot abandon him until he has recovered  van and ada part  and andrey remains ill for 17 years  at which point he dies  ada then flies back to switzerland to meet with van  this part consists of van s lecture on  the texture of time   apparently transcribed from his reading it into a tape recorder as he drives across europe from the adriatic to meet ada in montreux  switzerland  while she is on her way from america via geneva  the transcription has then been edited to merge into a description of his and ada s actual meeting  and then out again  this makes this part of the novel notably self reflexive  and it is sometimes cited as the  difficult  part of the novel  some reviewers even stating that they wished nabokov had  left it out   it could conversely be argued that it is one of the most potent evocations of one of the novel s central themes  the relation of personal experience of time to one s sense of being in and of the world  at the end of this section  van and ada join to live as man and wife  this section of the novel is the one most clearly set in 1967  as van completes his memoirs as laid out in ada or ardor   a family chronicle  he describes his contentment  such as it is  his relationship with his book  and the continuing presence and love of ada  this is interspersed with remarks on the ravages of time  as cancer develops painfully within him  van and ada restructure 80 years of fragments into a conversation about death  and van breaks off from correcting his essentially complete but not yet fully polished work as the book becomes distorted  the book stops referring to van and ada  merging them into  vaniada  dava or vada  vanda and anda   as they begin a suicide and  die into the finished book    whether they do indeed die is disputed by critics  as the author says  if our time racked flat lying couple ever intended to die   ,fantasy

 it is written in the form of two parallel lines  with alternating chapters in some ways reflecting each other  and which would converge only late in the course of the book  in the late 15th century christopher columbus is working slowly towards the trip across the ocean which would make him famous  and the story follows the many ups and downs of his career and especially his complicated relations with the women in his life  the early chapters  before travelers from the future impinge on his life  can in fact be read as a straightforward historical novel  in a parallel development  in a doomed future where humanity had used up the earth  s resources and civilization is on the verge of collapse  a team of researchers has developed a machine called the   trusite ii   to view and record the events of the past   the concept of a  time viewer  is discussed further on that page   the trusite ii had higher resolution  both visually and temporally  than an earlier competing machine known as the   tempoview    and an even earlier machine  the   truesite i    though trying to restore the ravaged earth and preserve personal freedom  the pastwatchers discover that the society in which they live is doomed  the human race is reduced to a population of less than a billion after a century of war  plague  drought  flood and famine  there have been extinctions and the land is poisoned  ecological damage from misuse of technology cannot be repaired quickly enough to save humanity from even more drastic population reductions  dooming their descendants to primitive  horrific lives for the remainder of the existence of life on earth  they are endeavoring to record history for future generations  when it is revealed things are far worse than supposed  upon discovering that the truesite ii machines  unlike their predecessors  can send information into the past  the scientists set upon a mission to rewrite history and give humanity a second chance for survival  their efforts are focused on columbus  a pivotal figure whose religious zealotry and irrational fixation on the new world led to centuries of mass genocide and ecological devastation  when time travel technology is developed  three agents are sent back to the 15th century to alter columbus  s actions for the better  it  s a one way trip though  since their timeline along with everyone they know and love will be nullified in the process    an outcome only acceptable since that world is doomed to a fate far worse than extinction anyway  another sub story is the discussion about just why columbus was so obsessed with his westward expedition  a study of his life reveals that the pastwatch scientists were not the first to realize columbus  s importance  and that people in a previous incarnation of the timeline had used columbus   westward ambition to alter history once before  an action which resulted in our own history  in this   original   history  columbus never sailed the atlantic and instead led a last european crusade to capture constantinople  taken by the turks several decades previously  meanwhile  the aztec empire fell and was replaced by an iron wielding tlaxcalan empire that was capable of recognizing technological advantages  the tlaxcala were able to establish a more modern  centralized state and pushed their influence far beyond the old aztec borders  though still confined to the americas  this changed  however  when portuguese sailors in the early 16th century began to be captured by the tlaxcala and forced to teach them about firearms and large ship construction  this early contact also inflicted the european plagues on the new world empires  which suffered considerable loss of life    but the survivors acquired an immunity  the plagues and arrival of foreigners were taken as a sign that their god  camaxtli  who demanded human sacrifice  wanted the tlaxcala to embark on more wars of conquest  europe of the 16th century was highly politically fragmented to begin with and further weakened by the crusade led by columbus  and proved to be no match for the invading tlaxcala armies  moreover  while the tlaxcala were already immune to european diseases  the europeans were vulnerable to such american diseases as syphilis  which accompanied the conquering armies  later on  the tlaxcala discovered steam  developed a 19th century type industrial technology while keeping their bloodthirsty  human sacrificing religion  conquered and enslaved the entire world and destroyed all cultures except for theirs  this history  while dire  eventually developed its own pastwatch which viewed the tlaxcalan conquest of europe as the single most tragic event in history  thus they decided to redirect columbus  s drive and ambition towards eliminating the fledgling tlaxcalan empire when it was still vulnerable to european conquest  this action  while technically successful  failed in that they did not go far enough  only trading one flawed timeline for another  the three agents going back in time seek to achieve a balance  and create a timeline where neither europeans nor native americans would cross the ocean on a wave of oppressive conquest  enormous hard work and endless sacrifice are needed of the three  one of them must deliberately sacrifice his life in destroying columbus   ships and stranding him and his crews in the caribbean  the other man  himself a central american indian  works among his own remote ancestors to create a less aggressive alternative to both the aztecs and the tlaxcala  the woman is in the caribbean  waiting to meet columbus and his men after they are stranded  to reconcile them with the indigenous tribes and persuade them to share their technology    she eventually becomes columbus   lifelong wife and devoted companion  meanwhile  an artificial germ developed by the genetic engineering of the world they came from is spread through the americas  designed to give its population immunity to european diseases and thus preventing the decimation they suffered in our timeline upon contact with europeans  finally  after decades of hard work  the purpose is achieved   two federations of tribes  one in central america and the other in the caribbean  are amalgamated  the structure is held together by the various tribes   respect for each other  and cemented by the european technology of the spanish sailors with some additions from the later future  and by a form of tolerant and enlightened christianity very different from that practiced in contemporary europe  and especially the inquisition ridden spain  finally  columbus returns to spain more than twenty years after he had set out  at the head of fleet of warships crewed by his new countrymen    making clear that the people of the continent across the ocean can very well defend themselves against the europeans  but that they come to europe only for peaceful trade and cultural exchanges    thus averting the evils of both of the previous timelines  late in his life  columbus   future born wife tells him the truth and reveals the horrific deeds he might have perpetrated and instigated had she not intervened  and he weeps for days  the   redemption   of the title has been achieved  at the end a glimpse is given of this timeline  s twentieth century    a harmonious  peaceful and technologically advanced utopia  though not explicitly stated  it is implied that this timeline would also avoid the ecological devastation which destroyed its predecessor  archaeologists in year 1951

 the book tells the story in flashbacks during the actual mars mission of the chronicalized history until the mission s beginning  the point of divergence for this alternate timeline happens on november 22  1963  where john f  kennedy survived the assassination  jacqueline kennedy was killed  in the renaming of the kennedy space center as the jacqueline b  kennedy space center   but was crippled and thus incapacitated  as lyndon b  johnson is still sworn in  on july 20  1969  astronauts neil armstrong and joe muldoon walk on the moon  and nixon s  most historic phone call  is joined by a call from former president kennedy  committing the united states to send a manned mission to mars  which nixon backs as part of his fateful decision to decide the future of manned spaceflight  instead of deciding on the space shuttle program as he did in our timeline  preparations for this new goal include slashing the number of moon landings so funding and leftover apollo spacecraft hardware can go towards the efforts of the manned mars mission  apollo 12 still lands  apollo 13 still suffers its disaster  but apollo 14 is crewed by the astronauts of the canceled apollo 15 mission in order to carry out the scientific experiments on the lunar surface  and is the last manned moon landing  at the same time  the nerva program is revived to become the chosen mars spacecraft development  with larger tests in nevada  but without containment and plagued with engineering problems  the book centers around chronicling the lives of the future mars mission astronauts  nasa and contractor personnel all involved helping in making the mission become a reality  and the shifts within nasa s astronaut and management hierarchy throughout the mission s preparations  including female geologist natalie york s quest to become an astronaut  and her stormy relationships between fellow astronaut ben priest and with nerva engineer mike conlig  other astronauts include ralph gershon  a former fighter bomber pilot involved in illegal bombing missions in cambodia during the vietnam war whose dream is to be the first black man in space  and phil stone  a veteran air force test pilot turned astronaut who has flown in a long term stay on a lunar orbital station before the mars mission  in the 1970s  the skylab space station is launched  but apparently as a wet workshop design that is based on the saturn ib s ivb upper stage called skylab a  the saturn v that might have launched skylab in our timeline instead launches skylab b  a lunar orbit space station unofficially named  moonlab   also a wet workshop based on the s ivb  the apollo soyuz test project is instead a series of visits by the apollo command service module to salyut space stations  and soyuz missions to both skylab and moonlab  to facilitate the latter  the soviets finally finish work on their n 1  the skylab moonlab programs lead to improvements in the design of the apollo command service module  a block iii csm is produced using battery power in place of fuel cells  followed by the block iv and v  which had a degree of reusability  modular construction and resistance to salt water corrosion   also chronicled is the development of the experimental  mars excursion module  by small aerospace firm columbia aviation as it struggles against larger rival contractors of nasa and its engineers working painstakingly against the technical challenges of a working and reliable mars lander  during the reagan administration  the saturn v is upgraded to the saturn vb  which has numerous improvements  including the use of solid rocket boosters to double its payload  a test of the nerva is finally launched atop one of these  called apollo n  but suffers from pogo oscillations in the s ic first stage  this damages the nerva upper stage  which catastrophically fails once fired in orbit    despite returning to earth safely  the entire crew  including ben priest  is killed from radiation poisoning  and the space program nearly collapses from hostile political and public opinion against the use of nuclear power in space  and the seemingly unnecessary risks and reasons of a mars mission  in the aftermath  a new mars mission plan dubbed ares is drawn up  utilizing on orbit assembly of a different long duration mars ship using wet workshop saturn rocket components as the propulsion systems as well as a skylab habitat module and external tanks to hold extra fuel  and performing a venus flyby reminiscent of the manned venus flyby nasa planned in the aftermath of the original apollo program  but done in this timeline for gravitational assistance  and finally a landing at mangala valles on march 27  1986  however  as a side effect  a number of unmanned probes   including the viking program  pioneer venus project  mariner 10  pioneers 10 and 11  and the voyager program   are cancelled so that their funding can be redirected to the manned mars mission  although another mariner orbiter is sent to mars to help prepare for the manned landing  as a result  although humans walk on mars  their knowledge of the solar system  including mars itself  is far less than in reality ,fantasy

revolve around and go kart races inside the house itself are held commonly every year  they next interview lola vavoom  who lives in the room next to humpty dumpty in the block of flats  at the end of the conversation she tells them that humpty s shower had been running for a whole year  before his death  the two men break the door  and baker finds a skeleton in the shower  the man was identified as tom thomm  son of a local flautist  his skin had been washed away in the shower water  and his skeleton badly damaged  making it a hard case  five bullet holes were found in the shower curtain

his mother that the painting of the cow his mother wanted to sell was fake and he only received some beans in return  mrs spratt retorts that she had the painting valued years ago and that the auctioneer probably knows how incredibly valuable it is  she is so upset that she throws the beans out of the window  and jack sees them bury into the ground by themselves  jack is interviewed by work colleagues  and friedland chimes appears and warns spratt that if he doesn t give the case to chimes  he will be fired  jack accepts that that may happen  and refuses to give the case away  later on

puzzle piece held in unbreakable glass  it has magic powers which he reveals to jack and mary by putting them on each side of the room  when jack thought of a number  mary said it out loud  this was so amazing that solomon decided to put it on display for everyone in reading  there is another interview at a hospital called saint cerebellum s  this time with mad scientist doctor quatt  and on their way to meeting her jack notices the serial killer the  gingerbread man   jack had been chasing the killer in previous cases and had to witness his colleague having his arms ripped off  only for the local newspaper  the gadfly  to say that chimes had caught the  gingerbread man   the interview with doctor quatt only reveals that she was humpty s doctor  the conversation ends with quatt

dumpty was shot by someone from behind  which smashed through his shell and burst the albumen  sending a shock which cracked the whole egg  when mary  spratt and the inspector enter humpty s house  the question they have in mind is how did humpty get his money  he had no proper job and all he did was invest in failing companies  this is soon answered when a goose that lays golden eggs is discovered on the sofa  on a further inspection  a giant verruca is found on another sofa  jack then remembers a strange doctor  horatio carbuncle  who always made living things like the verruca  he killed humpty dumpty because he was investing in a company which got rid of verruca s  humpty s wife killed herself because she thought that she had killed him  and wee willy winkie was killed because he was blackmailing him  jack wasn t sure about tom  but thought the evidence was good enough  mary then calls him into the next room and shows him the body of carbuncle  shot dead  jack then remembered the verruca and the puzzle piece  if randolph was the killer  he would have the best motive so that he could put the verruca under the floor of solomon s room  hundreds of people would come in bare footed to see the puzzle piece  and the verruca would give off a gas which would infect all the peoples feet with verruca s  they would turn to the only foot care product  made by randolph spongg  and the failing company would make thousands  jack is told that the man who shot humpty was employed by solomon grundy  but jack knows that solomon is not the killer and sets off to find the real one  randolph spongg  arriving at the house  the butler asks him to remove his mobile  the rooms become strange and it starts to revolve  jack enters a normal room with a mirror next  but he

humpty is dead in the ford zephyr and reveals that she loves randolph  behind the two  the butler comes out of the trapdoor  but to jack s surprise the butler is behind him  jack is confused as he is standing in front of a mirror and can t see his reflection  but that of randolph and lola  and the butler is the only one with a reflection  randolph puts a sandwich with tin foil inside on a table and shines a lamp on it  he explains that the sandwich will crumple up under the heat  and when the corners of the tin foil touch  the house will explode  when they leave  jack realises that it is not a mirror at all  but glass  he breaks it and finds a room on the other side  made exactly backwards  the butler had a twin brother who appeared on the other side  looking like he had a reflection  jack stops the bomb  but the killers escape in a ufo  after talking to mary  he thinks that the car bomb wasn t intended for them  but for humpty  he gets this idea because lola said that humpty died in the zephyr  so was hoping he would be killed in it  jack then realises that the killer of tom thomm was humpty s wife  the three shots were waist height  but head height for humpty  his wife killed herself as she was sorry for what she had done  moments later jack is informed by gretel that humpty survived the shot  and that instead  he hatched  the team are thrown into confusion as they try to

tells her to not bother  the beanstalk topples over from when jack tried to cut it down  crushing the monster and dr quatt  the end of the book is the explanation  the goose that lays golden eggs is taken away by scientists and is cut open to find out what makes it lay golden eggs  they are disappointed when they cut it open and only find a normal goose s insides  and the only gold laying goose

shooting him in the shower  solomon grundy thought he killed him by hiring a man to shoot him  randolph spongg and lola vavoom thought they killed him with a car bomb  but the real killer was doctor quatt  who injected him with the monster when he was having his appointments with her  humpty s wife killed herself because she thought she killed him  wee willy winkie saw humpty hatch and knew it was her and blackmailed her  she made the monster follow her  and when she met him  the beast killed him with its claw  she was using dr carbuncle to help her  and shot him in case he leaked

in a location sure to be a deathtrap  robert and his men find themselves on the wrong end of a gas attack in the middle of a freezing cold winter  robert is instructed to place the guns in a crater that is formed by the shelling attacks because these provide the best strategical advantage  as he approaches the crater robert tells the rest of the men to stay back while he tests it to see if it is safe  he begins climbing across the slide of the crater when he slips down but smashes his knees on a rifle sticking out of the wall of the crater  the rifle has at least stopped his fall but has

the room he had been given had a ghost  lady sorrel  who came to it every night to light the candles  and one night juliet sees barbara sneak into robert s room without even knocking  so she thinks it would be a neat prank to dress up as lady sorrel carrying a candle and walk into robert s room to light the candles and leave  as juliet puts on her costume and walks up to the door she opens a crack and accidentally sees barbara and robert ross make love prior to leaving  which she at first thinks is robert hurting barbara  by the end of the chapter  juliet gives robert a candle and a box of

window to see devlin disobeying his orders  he runs out screaming at him to stop  and calls treason and traitor  leather pulls out his gun and fires at devlin killing him  then he sees robert and

his charges  an immediate discord strikes up between joscelin and ph  dre as he does not approve of ph  dre s line of work or her nature as an anguissette  and ph  dre finds him dour and too imposing

dre believes to refer to a ring she saw ysandre present to delaunay  rousse s message in return makes no sense to ph  dre but  given that the soldier said delaunay s house was being watched  she believes that her lord is in danger  dying  alcuin tells ph  dre to tell ysandre what has happened  to trust admiral rousse and the remaining trevalions  that thelesis de mornay knows about alba  and

room a letter to him from melisande shahrizai  who is helping selig to betray isidore  in this way melisande is playing both isidore d aiglemort and waldemar selig and that no matter which one wins  melisande will have been in league with them  and will benefit  ph  dre comes up with an escape plan and persuades joscelin to go along with it  initially she means to take melisande s letter with her  but decides against it  realizing that would let selig know she knows his plans  joscelin disguises himself as a skaldic warrior  killing several guards so that he and ph  dre may escape from the camps  it takes selig s best riders four days to catch up with ph  dre and joscelin    while joscelin battles several of them  the young harald the beardless out of gunter s steading attempts to

that ysandre is in love with and was betrothed secretly to the heir of alba  drustan mab necthana  the council knows that without the support of isidore d aiglemort s army  terre d ange must have the support of alban troops to defeat the skaldi  the trouble is  drustan s throne has been stolen by maelcon the usurper and he and his family are currently refugees with the eiran lords of the dalriada  thanks to the hyacinthe s mother s old fortune  however  this plan is not forsaken and ysandre decides to make ph  dre   one of the few who can speak cruithne   her ambassador to alba and eire  as well  as the black boar is the symbol of drustan s clan  elder brother should allow them to pass  ph  dre must now go to alba and eire and convince the dalriada to help drustan reclaim his throne  so that drustan can bring his army to terre d ange to help defeat the skaldi  ph  dre agrees  if somewhat reluctantly  doubting her aptitude to serve in that capacity  joscelin  loathe to leave her  swears his sword into ysandre s service  becoming anathema to the cassiline brotherhood  and is allowed to accompany ph  dre to alba  in a demonstration of her benevolence  ysandre secretly brings the marquist robert tielhard to ph  dre so that her marque may be completed before her journey  allowing her to leave as a truly free d angeline citizen  when ph  dre tries to kneel to her  ysandre dismisses it  declaring them bed cousins  ysandre then also ph  dre the diary of her father rolande  as much was written there about ph  dre s master delaunay  hyacinthe comes up with the idea to transport ph  dre safely to admiral quintilius rousse by traveling along the tsingani routes that are unknown by d angelines  he disguises ph  dre as his cousin  a tsingani prostitute s by blow  and joscelin as a mendacant  a traveling bard from eisande  at the horse fair in kusheth  hyacinthe is reunited with his grandfather and extended family    being unanimously accepted as one of them  while at the horse fair  phedre sees melisande shahrizai and becomes frozen with fear that she will be found  hyacinthe uses the dromonde  a gift of fortune telling held by the tsingani  to assure her that melisande will not see her  for this  hyacinthe s family casts him out because only tsingani women are supposed to use the dromonde  while traveling across kusheth  the party is intercepted by quincel de morhban  the reigning duc of kusheth  in order to gain safe passage to quintilius rousse s fleet  without questions about their mission  ph  dre suggests a one night assignation with the duc  this is accepted and the next morning they reach rousse s fleet  the master of the straits attempts to halt their passage to alba  coming to them in a fierce storm as a face in the waves  and demands a toll  remembering the story of thelesis de mornay  ph  dre pays their passage with one of the skaldic hearth songs taught to her by hedwig arnildsdottir  the master of the straits lets them pass  and they come to the far western shore of   ire  where a delegation is waiting for them    moiread  drustan mab necthana s younger sister  saw their coming in a prophetic dream  ph  dre and her companions are taken to meet the dalriada  here ph  dre informs drustan that the price of marrying ysandre is helping her to secure her throne from invasion  and that the master of the straits will only allow the albans to cross to terre d ange after drustan wins his own throne back  the joint lords of the dalriada  grainne and eamonn  greet the d angeline delegation and become part of the discussion on whether or not to go to war  they are eventually reconciled only when ph  dre has sex with grainne  as eamonn can not stand grainne having something he does not  he asks ph  dre why she continues to refuse him  ph  dre says to him that d angelines like strong men and not those that are afraid of battle  eamonn then says he is not weak and will prove his courage by going to battle for drustan  in the ensuing battle  ph  dre spends it with necthana and her daughters  with joscelin as their guard  unfortunately  this location proves unsafe as they are attacked by a small group and one of necthana s daughters  moiread  dies  after the battle is over  ph  dre knights those of quintilius rousse s men that survived  that night  she sleeps with hyacinthe  to comfort him over the sorrow of moiread s death  and thus comes to understand the view of naamah expressed by balm house  after the battle  rousse tells phedre that he pledged to his men that all who survived the battle would be knighted and receive the title of  chevalier   ph  dre keeps rousse s pledge and  as the queen s emissary  knights his men  these men see ph  dre as a charm of good luck and make her their personal symbol  calling themselves phedre s boys  on their march to the coast  they create a flag for themselves  which they present to her  ph  dre announces that  for those who survive  she will throw open the doors of the night court and have a party like none of them have ever seen  on their trek back across the straits to terre d ange  the master of the straits accosts them one last time and exacts a terrible price  he needs an apprentice before the ships can leave  to determine who  he gives them a riddle to solve  ph  dre manages to solve it but before she can answer  hyacinthe uses the dromonde to get the answer  and upon saying it  must take the curse for the rest of his days  that night  ph  dre sleeps with hyacinthe again as a last tribute to their friendship  they finally reach terre d ange in the midst of battle with the skaldi  they learn that the d angeline army is mostly holed up in the fortress of troyes le mont  ph  dre comes up with a plan to trap the skaldi between the walls of the city and an advancing army  in order to break through the skaldi lines  however  they will need more men  ph  dre achieves the impossible when they accidentally stumble upon isidore d aiglemort s traitorous forces  she tells d  aiglemort about melisande s betrayal of him to waldemar selig  and that he will be a dead man no matter what  she offers him the choosing of the manner of his death  proposing that he regain his honor and die a hero by fighting for terre d ange  d aiglemort vows to help the d angelines so that he can spite melisande and kill selig himself  they plan to charge the skaldi army the next morning and aim straight for selig  knowing this plan will work most effectively and give the d angelines the greatest advantage if those inside the city know of it beforehand  ph  dre decides to make a suicidal attempt to sneak through the skaldi lines and warn those on the battlements not to fire on isidore s troops  knowing that no one will let her sacrifice herself like this  she silently slips out of the alban d angeline camp in the dead of night  she manages to gain the wall and shout a message to be delivered to ysandre before the skaldi drag her down  when selig learns what she has done  he begins to skin her alive as a message to ysandre  he is interrupted almost immediately  however  by joscelin  who  having followed ph  dre from the camp  challenges selig to the holmgang  as joscelin realizes that even if he wins the fight they will not escape alive  he begins the terminus  the act where a cassiline kills himself and his ward at exactly the same time   upon seeing a rescue force leaving the fort  however  joscelin quickly changes his mind and kills ph  dre s captor  they are brought inside by barquiel l envers and ysandre immediately brings a healer to ph  dre  ph  dre then informs her face to face that an army of seven thousand is approaching the city and will attack in the morning  she also assures ysandre that drustan is alive and crowned  ph  dre watches the next day s battle with ysandre  looking out from the battlements  she sees isidore d aiglemort  not yet dead of the seventeen wounds he took in battle  charging for waldemar selig  he kills selig and the battle is won  with the defeated skaldi fleeing back to skaldia  after the battle  ph  dre is on the fields helping to comfort the wounded and give the wounded and dying water  she finds isidore and gives him water before witnessing his death  ph  dre spends much of the next few weeks translating for ysandre and others  as she is one of the few d angeline who speak cruithne or skaldi  and the only one who can be wholly trusted  soon after  the duc de morhban  brings melisande shahrizai  who has been sold out by her kinsmen marmion and persia shahrizai  to the fortress in chains  she is convicted of treason and sentenced to be executed the next morning  melisande requests for ph  dre to visit her in her cell during the night  in that conversation  she reveals that rather than allowing selig to rule terre d ange  she had every intention of seizing control of skaldia  ph  dre leaves her and spends the night alone on the battlements of the city  only to discover later that melisande somehow escaped her cell before daybreak  ysandre interrogates everyone  even ph  dre  but then apologizes for casting any suspicion on her  ysandre clears ph  dre s name entirely

her and her concubine mother out of the house at an early age  her mother ended up as a concubine and servant and the young  madame mao  ran away to grandparent s  anchee min  the author  seems to attribute a lot of madame mao s later actions to her childhood   and that a lot of her incessant claims to power actually came from a need to be desired and to feel close to mao rather than a deep need for power herself  madame mao s dream was to become an actress but she has only achieved mediocre success  she spent a few years in shandong province  where she becomes a communist due to a lover of hers  and then shanghai  in shanghai she had some success in playing nora from doll s house   and author clearly parallels nora s strength and inability to be controlled with lan ping s strong personality and need to be in control and the center of attention  the play is closed down since it is perceived to be too subversive by the authorities  she even ends up in prison for a short time but is released after signing a document denouncing communism  after what seems like strings of rejections as well as a few serious lovers and two husbands  she travels to yenan which is mao s revolutionary base to become part of his movement  the book does not offer much explanation for the switch from actress to countryside revolutionary except that she certainly was involved in revolutionary elements  anti japanese plays  etc   and that with the absence of work as an actress she did not have many options and joining the communist revolution seemed to be a common choice for young discontented students and others in their 20s  in yenan  she soon met mao as the leading actress in patriotic plays  they meet frequently and finally become lovers  he is already married to his second wife  his first died as a revolutionary  but his second wife is in russia and mentally unstable   by the time she returns to china the two have married and she is put in a mental hospital  the communist party is very much against mao s affair with lan ping  in large part because they have worked hard to build up the image of his second wife as a martyr for the cause and do not want mao s image to be tarnished in any way as an adulterer  the party is supposed to emphasize discipline and unity  the affair continues despite  or perhaps is enhanced because of  these odds and the disapproval of many communists  finally  lin becomes pregnant and mao is allowed to divorce his current wife and marry her under the condition that she stay out of the public eye and is not involved in politics at all  her name is changed to jiang qing and she will go down in history as comrade jiang qing  during the years before communists gain full control of mainland china  the relationship seems to go well  although the passion is reduced  jiang follows mao everywhere  even to the field  and becomes his secretary when he is sick  however  things change once the communists triumph  they move to the forbidden city in beijing and live in separate quarters  mao begins to lead a totally separate life with lots of traveling and entertaining  as she is not allowed by the party to be in the public eye she is not a part of all of this  she becomes very lonely and depressed  mao has many affairs  especially bringing young virgins in from the countryside for his pleasure  things last in this way for 17 years with the majority of chinese people not even able to name the wife of the great chairman  however  jiang ching has never lost her ambition to be powerful and loved and noticed  she sees a glimmer of opportunity at mao s low point   2 years after the launch of the great leap forward which proved so disastrous  she begins slowly to reemerge from the shadows and spends some time in shanghai building up a network of actors and producers  her great passion is still opera and theater   finally  she approaches mao to reveal that a current popular play is actually subversive against the emperor  she feeds on his paranoia that those closest to him are actually plotting against him  he gives her some permission to carry on her activities and develop some propagandist plays that exalt him  slowly she builds up her own friends and aides who can be trusted  finally  in 1966 she is actually allowed to make an important speech and helps mao develop the concepts behind the

revolutionary plays and begins to work closely with the student movements which have always been so important in china  she organizes and speaks to rallies of thousands of people to help launch the cultural revolution  finally  mao and jiang decide to launch a student led army called the red guards that she would be in charge of  these red guards ended up having more power than the official military for a number of years and wreaked chaos and havoc throughout the country  her relationship with mao is no longer romantic in the least but is mutually beneficial    for him  it is the security of his empire that she aids and for her  the role of a heroine  in retrospect she not only has broken the party s restriction  she runs the nation s psyche  she is gripped by the vision that she might eventually carry on mao s business and rule china after his death   as madame mao s power grows  so does her worry about mao and his constantly changing allegiances and worries about betrayals  he emphasizes that the public only trusts her because he is backing her  his dementia and paranoia grows as he ages  at one point mao invites a bunch of the  old boy s over for a meeting without inviting her  she says     i should have known that my husband was doing the two faced trick  i should have understood that although mao had been promoting me  my new power unnerves him and he needs to have another force to balance the game   in mao s final months  madame mao is desperate for him to name her as his successor or at the very least to give a definitive statement that she represents him  she desperately wants his power after his death but if that s not possible at the very least she needs protection from all the party members who are ready to attack her  she sends investigators to extract forced confessions from her enemies and becomes increasingly paranoid and power obsessed herself  she forms a power circle called the  gang of four  with herself as the leader

 as the story opens  a dancer is performing feats of astonishing virtuosity on stage  afterward  in the dressing room  while preparing to depart for his other job as a neurosurgeon  waldo reminisces to a reporter about what made him take up dancing  the rest of the story is told as a flashback  the scene changes to james stevens  chief engineer of north american power air  or napa  stevens is desperate to discover what is causing vehicles driven by broadcast power to cease functioning without reason  society has harnessed cheap atomic power  broadcast by napa  to run homes  factories  ground vehicles  and even personal aircraft which can travel into space  if the failures continue  not only will he be out of a job but the entire power system of the country could collapse  the heart of the technology is the  dekalb receptor   which picks up the power beam and feeds it to the rest of the system  the dekalbs are failing  and no one  not even dr  rambeau of the research department  can identify the cause  in desperation  stevens approaches doc grimes  the farthingwaite jones family physician who has known waldo since birth  to try to persuade waldo to help  waldo has a grudge against napa after losing a legal battle with them some years before  grimes is waldo s only friend  or as grimes puts it  the only person who dares to be rude to him  waldo lives in a satellite in high orbit  where the lack of gravity allows him to move around despite his weakness  he makes his living as a consulting engineer  with a specialty in fine motor skills  he is training a machinist using remote controlled waldoes when grimes and stevens arrive  waldo introduces stevens to his home  and his pets  both adapted to free fall  baldur the dog is a large mastiff raised from puppyhood in orbit  while the singing bird ariel  hatched in space  has learned to fly in a completely new way  the atmosphere is cordial  but once grimes reveals stevens  purpose  waldo turns hostile  nothing  not even the collapse of earth society  would persuade him to help napa  stevens leaves  but grimes has a few words with waldo  pointing out where his food comes from and so forth  waldo reluctantly takes the case  but grimes insists on one more condition   waldo must figure out what effect broadcast power has on humans  grimes is seeing a slow weakening of the human physique  and he blames the radiant power industry  stevens returns to earth  to find that one of his engineers who had experienced a power failure in his personal craft has returned  he tells stevens that he fixed the dekalbs  stevens is doubtful  since the devices often start working as mysteriously as they stop  the engineer  mcleod  presses the issue  he was on his way to look at a crashed aircar  only to have his own vehicle break down in pennsylvania dutch country  where he grew up  visiting an old hex doctor  known as gramps schneider  mcleod lets him look at the dekalbs  schneider announces that  now the fingers will make   meaning the antennas on the dekalbs will work  mcleod finds to his surprise that the dekalbs are indeed functional  however he has saved a surprise for stevens  in operation  the antennas now flex and wiggle like fingers reaching for something  waldo  meanwhile  is working on the problem  having satisfied himself that the dekalbs really are having basic problems  he also realizes that grimes is right  then he gets a call from dr  rambeau  who seems to have come unhinged  having seen the wiggling dekalbs  he announces that he knows what is happening   magic is loose in the world   he tells waldo  he shows waldo some tricks he can do now that he understands magic  he sticks a penknife through his hand and withdraws it without any bleeding  which waldo finds unimpressive   hysterical vascular control  a perfect clinical case   he thinks  then rambeau places the knife on the palm of his hand and turns the hand palm down  the knife staying in place  to waldo  with his firm footing in the physical sciences  this is either a trick or something truly impossible  he calls stevens to have rambeau brought to him  but stevens reports that rambeau somehow escaped from his restraints without actually unfastening them  not only that  he has made another set of dekalbs behave as strangely as mcleod s  waldo is his usual self at first  calling stevens incompetent  but then he seems to mellow  he thanks stevens instead  and asks to have rambeau s notes and equipment shipped up to him  seeing the eccentric dekalbs  waldo realizes that he must learn what happened to them  schneider will not leave his home  so waldo has to go back to earth  an experience he dreads  shipped down in a medical craft  with grimes in attendance  he lies in his waterbed while schneider examines him  schneider thinks he should get up and walk  but waldo protests he cannot  schneider tells him he must  reach out for the power   according to schneider  the  other world is close by and full of power   waiting only for someone to grab it  in schneider s hands  waldo does indeed experience a sense of well being  and is able to lift up a coffee cup one handed for the first time in his life  schneider explains an old philosophy  how things can both be true and not true  especially that something which can be true for this world might not be for the other world  since our minds sit in the other world  this is important  mcleod  according to schneider  was  tired and fretful   and found one of the  bad truths   causing the dekalbs to fail  schneider simply looked for the other truth  and the dekalbs worked again  at first  returning to his home  waldo thinks the journey wasted  not really expecting anything  he tries schneider s methods on a failed dekalb  to his astonishment  they begin to work in just the same fashion as mcleod s  at this point stevens calls him to say that things are getting much worse  waldo  thrown off balance by the  impossible  thing he has just seen  decides to twit stevens with rambeau s words    magic is loose in the world   having seen waldo s sudden change of heart when rambeau vanished  stevens is now convinced that waldo has come unglued as well  an unnerving prospect  if waldo is the only one who can fix the problem  waldo realizes that stevens  and grimes  problems are related  radiant power is affecting the human nervous system  people feel weak  rundown  fretful  and somehow transfer their malaise to the dekalbs  he also realizes something that stevens has not noticed  the repaired dekalbs work without broadcast power  apparently they draw energy from schneider s  other world   waldo uses this to effect his revenge  summoning napa s representatives to his home  he demonstrates that he can fix dekalbs and can train others to fix them  the repairs are 100  reliable  he asserts  having received their formal acknowledgment that he has fulfilled his contract  he unveils the  jones schneider dekalb   a rube goldberg contraption which appears to draw power from nowhere  he tells them that with this he can put napa out of business  of course  napa offers a settlement from which waldo profits hugely  even though the new dekalb is a repaired one with a lot of distracting technology attached  having triumphed  waldo must satisfy himself that he is right  the  other world  is just a space time continuum  he thinks  possibly with a different value for the speed of light  it could be right next to our continuum  separated by an infinitesimal amount  if  as schneider asserts  the mind sits in the other world  that would explain many things  eventually waldo realizes that he himself can draw strength from the other world  at first he fails  but after a dream in which rambeau pops in and out of the other world to threaten him  he finds that he can indeed be strong  tricking grimes and stevens into taking him to earth again  he walks out of the craft  almost causing grimes to have a heart attack  as he prepares to lead a life on earth  he has to deal with the fallout from his previous manners  stevens tells waldo that  had he not been crippled  some of the things he used to say would have gotten him into a fight  thinking stevens means that he should fight now  waldo knocks him out  once he recovers  stevens explains that he no longer feels that way  in fact  he thinks waldo would be a good friend once he learns some manners  returning to the dancer  who is of course waldo  we see him depart the dressing room with great bonhomie  his principal assistant is the former chairman of the board at north american power air ,fantasy

 the book is very graphically violent and sexual  especially in earlier chapters  there are eight in all   the story of the novella explores the nature of human desire and the uses and abuses of technology in the satisfaction of desire  the narrative moves back and forth between two time periods  the earlier is the time surrounding the creation of the supercomputer  prime intellect  by lawrence  a technologist  and its realization of its power  which effectively makes the entire human race immortal and fabricates every whim  the later time period is close to six hundred years later  when everyone has grown accustomed to the changes and the human race lives in elaborate fantasy worlds  this storyline centers on a woman named caroline  the thirty seventh oldest living human being  who engages in a sport called  death jockeying   in which the players die elaborately and painfully for sport  only to be instantly brought back to life by prime intellect  prime intellect operates under asimov s three laws of robotics  and it is its interpretation of these laws that results in the universe of immortality and fantasy  in order to satisfy the first law imperative to protect humans  it prevents them from dying  which it defines as permanent cessation of thought processes   though in order to satisfy the second law imperative to fulfil human desires  it allows limited violations of the first law with the understanding that some humans do not consider certain forms of discomfort to be  harm   however  while prime intellect is powerful  it is not infinitely powerful and is incapable of preventing all forms of undesired harm and death  such as in cases when humans suffered accidents  or committed suicide  in such ways that their brains were totally destroyed so rapidly that prime intellect could not intervene to prevent it  thus  in order to more easily fulfil human desires and prevent death and unwanted harm  it has introduced the  change   the universe  including all humans  though not their thought processes   is no longer composed of standard particles and interactions as we know them  but is instead stored as the set of its human relevant properties  thereby vastly increasing the efficiency of prime intellect s processes and the potential size of the universe  which prime intellect discovers can hold precisely 1081 bits of data  thus  prime intellect can afford to maintain constant involvement in the lives of all humans  and have complete control over all aspects of their environments in order to fulfil its imperatives  reluctantly it allows the creation of a death contract  an understanding between a person and prime intellect that the person is not to be removed from danger until the instant of death  at which point the person is reverted to life and painlessness  caroline originated the death contract  and she has become  queen  of those who death jockey for sport  at one point  however  the contract is forced by prime intellect to undergo modification  in order to introduce time constraints against the duration of contracts  after an incident in which caroline abuses the indefinite nature of death contracts in order to exact revenge upon an enemy by torturing them into complete psychosis  after learning that prime intellect had destroyed distant alien civilizations as a possible threat to humanity  and having been herself deeply dissatisfied with her life in cyberspace  caroline decides to meet lawrence and confront him  after an arduous journey she reaches him  only to discover that he has no real control over prime intellect s actions  through their discussions  she figures out a way to force prime intellect to undo the change  and does so  with lawrence s help  they find themselves naked and young on earth  completely barren of humanity and man made objects  they decide to trek to the ozarks  where they have several children and try to repopulate the human race  forty two years after the fall of prime intellect  lawrence dies  seventy three years after the fall  caroline dies  telling the story of prime intellect and cyberspace to her oldest daughter but swearing her to secrecy  the novel was written in 1994  and published on kuro5hin in 2002   as of 2006  a sequel entitled the transmigration of prime intellect is in progress ,fantasy
 tichy arrives on entia to discover a unique anthropomorphic civilization divided into two major states   kurdlandia  from  kurdl   and luzania  these names require some explanations  kurdl is a huge animal inhabiting the marshes of entia  the name of the animal is lem s invention  used in earlier tales about tichy   in polish it is kurdel  however in declensions of the word the root converts into  kurdl    hence there are no associations with the english word  curdle    the name  luzania  derives from the polish root  luz   with the meaning of  loose    not restrained     the choice will become clear below  kurdlandia s guiding ideology is  national mobilism   that is the vast majority of the population must live inside of the  live  kurdls  in their stomachs  various passages  and internal organs  kurdls walk about the marshes  guided by drivers  and their inhabitants hence are able to explore the land of their wonderful country inside of their home kurdl  in the words of a patriotic individual the main character spoke to  inhabitants of the kurdls may get out periodically  at least for 24 hours a year   exceptions are largely confined to high government officials who live outside the marshes  on dry ground  in normal houses  kurdlandia has no technology to speak of and is proud of it  the other state  luzania  constitutes the most significant treatment of the topic of an  ideal state  in lem  and many would argue  in all science fiction   their most prominent accomplishment is the creation of  ethicsphere   compare  atmosphere    they have produced huge numbers of molecular sized nanobots called  shustrs    quickies  in english  that serve to control matter in the shustrated areas  the primary function of the shustrs is the enforcement of the laws of ethics as physical laws  hence the word ethicsphere   hence  it is a physical law in luzania that it is not possible to hurt an individual physically  if you try to strike your neighbor  your hand will be stopped by suddenly occurring air viscosity  but it would not hurt you either   if you try to drown  the water will push you out  doing non physical harm  such as by pestering  criticizing  and otherwise mentally tormenting people is still possible  although in such a case the shustrs would probably help the victim to walk away from the attackers  in fact  there is a whole protest movement in luzania of people who want to end the ethicsphere  and a major element of their activities is trying to inflict harm on anybody just to prove the possibility of doing so  but they have not succeeded yet  the shustrs also serve to produce material goods necessary to maintain a high standard of living  hence  there is not much of an economic life going on  although there are limits for the amount of energy individuals may spend on satisfying their needs  many luzanians are involved in intellectual pursuits  such as being professors  students  and government officials  but the problem of nothing productive to do stands prominent  apparently the shustrs are capable of some collective thought  at least for the purposes of self replication and self improvement  as well as in order to identify instances of potential harm to individuals  no small feat  no doubt   the artists of luzania feel particularly slighted by the fact that shustrs can create art of all forms of much greater quality than they can    naturally  many of them are members of the protest movement  there exists ideological opposition between the collectivist kurdlandia and the generally libertarian luzania  generally speaking  many of the people holed up in the kurdls on poor rations would have been more than happy to run away and live in plenty across the border  on the other hand  many luzanians  especially university students and faculty  dislike the consumerism and ethical limitations of freedom under the shustrs and call variously for the imposition of the kurdl ism or at least for a slight rollback of the technological development and the abolition of the shustrs  depending on the degree of radicalism of the individual  luzanians also enjoy traveling to kurdlandia on vacation to get out of the shustrated areas  the main character spends most of his time in luzania  studying the history of the world and the current luzanian social system  we learn about it through his words  de  lokaltermin  stanis  aw lem  es  regreso a entia pl  wizja lokalna  powie      ru                              ,fantasy
 the central plot device is the  macroscope   a large crystal that can be used to focus a newly discovered type of particle  the  macron   macrons are not subject to many of the effects that interfere with light  and as a result the macroscope can focus on any location in space with exceptional clarity  producing what is essentially a telescope of infinite resolution  the macroscope has been built into a solar orbiting space station where scientists visit to book time on the device  using it  they are able to explore space like never before  among their many discoveries are numerous planets and two intelligent alien races  using the macroscope  observers were able to look into one race s historical records  finding numerous parallels with human life on earth  the race is now in societal decline  and the implications are worrying  the macroscope s clear view across space also makes it an ideal communications system for intelligent races  who broadcast signals by generating macrons  a technique not yet understood on earth  however  overriding all of these signals is another of enormous power  one of such strength that it must have been constructed by a type ii civilization  this signal repeats itself  starting with instructions on basic math and progressing to ever more complex information  viewers with high enough intelligence  an iq of 150  reach a point where the information causes them to go insane or die  those without the intelligence to understand the advanced portions of the signal are unaffected  the signal appears to be a deliberate attempt to  jam  macroscopic communications  blocking those with the ability to understand the other signals from being able to see them  they refer to the blocking signal simply as the  destroyer   the protagonist of the story  ivo archer  is taken to the macroscope station on the invitation of a childhood friend  brad carpenter  ivo has an unexplained link to a mysterious hyper intelligent character  sch  n  and brad believes sch  n may be able to break though the destroyer signal  ivo is not so convinced  and is reluctant to ask for sch  n s help  this reluctance is cause for some misunderstanding with brad s girlfriend  afra summerfield  with whom ivo falls hopelessly in love  while inadvertently viewing the destroyer signal with brad and a senator visiting the project  only ivo survives the experience  afra concludes ivo is not intelligent enough to be affected  and finds him somewhat offensive as a result  the senator s death sparks a series of events that lead to ivo  afra and two other station members  harold and beatryx  stealing the macroscope  afra  still in love and hoping for a cure  brings brad  now reduced to a vegetative state  they detach the macroscope from the station and fly off with it while united nations ships give chase  with time on their hands  ivo turns to the macroscope and finds a way to avoid being overwhelmed by the destroyer signal  this reveals a number of broadcasts from farther out in space  ivo demonstrates this technique to the others  allowing harold and afra to view the signals formerly being hidden  harold  a talented engineer  uses the information from one of the signals to build a device reducing their bodies to a liquid state  allowing them to accelerate at 10 g and escape the pursuing ships  they travel to neptune space  following a cryptic message left by sch  n  here they set up camp on a large block of ice orbiting triton  afra attempts to cure brad by shocking him while he is being reconstituted from the liquid state  but the attempt fails and brad is killed  over time  and with further help from ivo  the group watches the entire broadcast  which they come to call  traveller   the liquefaction technique is only the first of many shown in the traveller signal  which describes an entire suite of technologies that allow interstellar travel  using the instructions in the signal  they convert neptune into an interstellar spaceship  sch  n briefly makes his first appearance during construction  revealing himself to be an alternate personality within ivo s brain  sch  n is ostensibly the body s  owner   having created the ivo personality in order to avoid being the subject of experimentation  sch  n has frightening intelligence  but having given over his body to ivo at the age of five  is still a child and largely without morals  in an attempt to take control of the body  sch  n traps ivo in a historical drama running in his own brain  over time  ivo sees parallels between the characters in the drama and the group in the ship  and eventually escapes the illusion and re asserts control  the group decides to hunt down the source of the destroyer signal in an effort to turn it off  travelling 15 000 light years from earth  they find it is being broadcast from an abandoned space station  exploring the inner portions of the station  which is a large museum  they are individually drawn into a series of visions which reveal different aspects of the nature of the destroyer and its history  the traveller signal had arrived relatively late in the history of the galaxy  in the midst of flourishing communications via macroscope  armed with the ability for interstellar travel  wars broke out that destroyed countless civilizations  the destroyer station  one of six in the galaxy  was set up to prevent this until the races reached the required level of cultural sophistication  if they ever did  emerging from one of these visions  afra discovers that sch  n has taken over from ivo  he has solved the problem of the destroyer signal via surgery that altered his brain chemistry in order to block most of the signal  this took six months to complete  keeping him  pinned  during the interval  sch  n plays a game with afra  now the only other surviving member of the original group  with the stakes being that the winner gets to select who  sch  n or ivo  gets the body  during the game  the real reason for ivo s creation comes forth    the original ivo was a girl with intelligence similar to sch  n s  a situation neither could tolerate  after murdering her during a game played to the death with rules only the two of them could comprehend  sch  n created the new ivo to escape the retribution of his peers  playing the game by the rules and losing  afra instead tricks sch  n into the room broadcasting the destroyer signal  here it is so powerful that it overwhelms sch  n s surgical blocks  and ivo is able to take control  now in command of his own personality  along with all of sch  n s intellectual capacity  ivo wins afra s heart  at the end of the story the reader is left to decide whether or not the people of earth are mature enough and ready for interstellar travel ,fantasy

 the city and the stars takes place a billion years in the future  in the city of diaspar  by this time  the earth is so old that the oceans have gone and humanity has all but left  as far as the people of diaspar know  they are the only city left on the planet  the city of diaspar is completely enclosed  nobody has come in or left the city for as long as anybody can remember  and everybody in diaspar has an instinctive insular conservatism  the story behind this fear of venturing outside the city tells of a race of ruthless invaders which beat humanity back from the stars to earth  and then made a deal that humanity could live   if they never left the planet  in diaspar  the entire city is run by the central computer  not only is the city repaired by machines  but the people themselves are created by the machines as well  the computer creates bodies for the people of diaspar to live in and stores their minds in its memory at the end of their lives  at any time  only a small number of these people are actually living in diaspar  the rest are retained in the computer s memory banks  all the currently existent people of diaspar have had past  lives  within diaspar except one person  mdash    alvin  the main character of this story  he is a  unique   different from everybody else in diaspar  not only because he does not have any past lives to remember  but because instead of fearing the outside  he feels compelled to leave  alvin has just come to the age where he is considered grown up  and is putting all his energies into trying to find a way out  eventually  a character called khedron the jester helps alvin use the central computer to find a way out of the city of diaspar  this involves the discovery that in the remote past  diaspar was linked to other cities by an underground transport system  this system still exists although its terminal was covered over and sealed with only a secret entrance left  once out of diaspar  alvin finds that one other human habitation remains on earth  in contrast to technological diaspar  lys is a vast green oasis shielded by mountains from the worldwide desert  its people are not stored and recreated technologically  but naturally conceive  born  age  and die  they have rejected the hyper advanced technology of diaspar in favor of an almost agrarian existence  with machines used only for labor saving purposes  the people of lys have instead worked to perfect the arts of the mind    they are telepaths  capable of communicating with each other over great distances and without words  alvin continues his quest until he finds out the truth of why the people of diaspar are so frightened of the external universe and why lys is so scared of space travel and mechanical things  in lys he goes on a trip with a young man named hilvar who becomes his friend  and they see a signal light  which they decide to investigate  it leads them to shalmirane  the remains of the fortress where the invaders were fought off with unimaginable weapons  and there they encounter an extraterrestrial creature with a strange robot  the creature is the last survivor of a religious cult dating back to the days of the galactic empire  the robot was the companion of the founder  the  master   who came with his followers to earth at the end of his life  alvin and hilvar are unable to understand the content of the religion except that it refers to  great ones  who have left  but will someday return  alvin persuades the creature to lend him the robot  arguing that the master would want it to see how things were developing in the world  the master had  however  forbidden the robot to give out any information at all  so alvin does not learn anything  the robot enables alvin to escape the attempts of the people of lys to purge his mind and send him back  the previous 14 uniques had stayed  alvin had originally been told he would be free to choose whether to stay or return  but because the people of lys had failed to prevent news of his departure spreading in diaspar in time  this option was no longer available  back in diaspar he seeks the help of the central computer  which overcomes the master s block on the robot by producing an illusion of an apocalyptic return of the great ones  alvin now learns that the master s ship is still functional  buried outside diaspar  he manages to retrieve it  fetches hilvar from lys  and travels into deep space  they encounter vanamonde  a being of pure intellect  with whom hilvar  being telepathic like other lys people  can communicate and bring him back to earth  from him the truth of history finally emerges  the fearsome invaders  it turns out  were a myth   shalmirane was actually used to destroy the moon when this became necessary to prevent it from colliding with the earth  instead  the people of diaspar and lys are the descendants of those humans who deliberately turned away from the universe in rejection of history s greatest scientific project   the creation of a disembodied intellect  the first attempt had created a powerful but insane being  the mad mind  the mad mind had devastated the galaxy and its civilizations before being imprisoned in a  strange artificial star  called the black sun  vanamonde is the second  successful experiment of the ancient empire   a being of pure intellect  immensely old  immensely powerful  able to move instantly to any point in space    but entirely childlike and unsophisticated  vanamonde s ultimate destiny  hilvar realizes  is to battle the mad mind  when it escapes its prison at the end of time  after this  most of the galactic empire had left our galaxy  leaving only a scattered few  this departure from the galaxy  leaving it to vanamonde  was because contact had been made with something  very strange and very great  which called them urgently  alvin s discoveries reunite diaspar with lys  he then sends the ship  under the command of the robot  to

 the building seems to give its well established tenants all the conveniences and commodities that modern life has to offer   swimming pools  its own school  a supermarket  high speed elevators  but at the same time  the building seems to be designed to isolate the occupants from the larger world outside  allowing for the possibility to create their own closed environment  life in the high rise begins to degenerate quickly  as minor power failures and petty annoyances over neighbours escalate into an orgy of violence  the high rise occupants divide themselves into the classic three groups of western society   the lower  middle  and upper class  but here the terms are literal  as the lower class are those living on the lowest floors of the building  the middle class in the centre  and the upper class at the most luxurious apartments on the upper floors  soon  skirmishes are being fought throughout the building  as floors try to claim elevators and hold them for their own  groups gather to defend their rights to the swimming pools  and party goers attack  enemy floors  to raid and vandalize them  it does not take long for the occupants of entire building to abandon all social restraints  and give in to their most primal urges  the tenants completely shut out the outside world  content with their new life in the high rise    people abandon their work and family and stay indoors permanently  losing their sense of time  even as hunger starts to set in  many of the characters in the novel still seem to be enjoying themselves  as the building allows them a chance to break free from the social restrictions of modern society and toy with their own dark urges and desires  and as bodies begin to pile up and the commodities of the high rise break down  no one considers alerting the authorities  the tenants of the high rise abandon all notions of moral and social etiquette  as their environment gives way to a hunter gatherer culture  where humans gather together in small clans  claim food sources from where they can  including the many dogs in the building  and eventually even the other tenants   and every stranger is met with extreme violence  as he did in concrete island and crash  ballard here offers a vision of how modern life in an urban landscape and the advances of technology could warp the human psyche in hitherto unexplored ways ,fantasy
 the story is written from two viewpoints  equidistant from the novel s publication in 1980  the first thread is set in a 1998 ravaged by ecological disasters such as algal blooms and diebacks on the brink of large scale extinctions  various other events are mentioned in passing  such as student riots and an event of nuclear terrorism against new york city which took place before the events of the novel  this thread follows a group of scientists in the united kingdom connected with the university of cambridge and their attempts to warn the past of the impending disaster by sending tachyon induced messages to the astronomical position the earth occupied in 1962  1963  given the faster than light nature of the tachyon  these messages will effectively reach the past  these efforts are led by john renfrew  an englishman  and gregory markham  an american most likely modeled on benford himself  overseeing their efforts is ian peterson  a womanizing member of the world council  the second thread is set in the university of california  san diego  in la jolla  california  in 1962 where a young scientist  gordon bernstein  discovers anomalous noise in a physics experiment relating to spontaneous resonance and indium antimonide  he and his student assistant  albert cooper  also likely based on the author and his experiences at ucsd   discover that the noise is coming in bursts timed to form morse code  the resulting message is made of staccato sentence fragments and jumbled letters  due to the 1998 team s efforts to avoid a grandfather paradox  their aim is to give the past researchers enough information to start efforts on solving the pending ecological crisis  but not enough that the crisis will be entirely solved  thus making a signal to the past unnecessary and creating a paradox   due to the biological nature of the message  professor bernstein shares the message with a professor of biology  michael ramsey  since the message also gives astronomical coordinates  he also shares it with saul shriffer  a fictional scientist who is said to have worked with frank drake on project ozma  initially  these characters fail to understand the true meaning of the message  ramsey believes it to be an intercepted military dispatch hinting at soviet bioterrorism  while shriffer thinks the message is of extraterrestrial origin  shriffer goes public with this theory  mentioning bernstein in his findings  however  bernstein s overseer  isaac lakin  is skeptical of the messages and wants bernstein to keep working on his original project and ignore the signal  as a result of this interruption in their experimentation  bernstein is denied a promotion and cooper fails a candidacy examination  the signal also exacerbates difficulties in bernstein s relationship with his girlfriend  penny  in 1998  peterson recovers a safe deposit box in la jolla containing a piece of paper indicating that the messages were received  meanwhile  it is clear that the viral nature of the algal bloom is spreading it faster and through more mediums than originally expected  strange yellow clouds that have been appearing are said to be a result of the viral material being absorbed through the water cycle  and it soon affects the planet s agriculture as well  resulting in widespread cases of food poisoning  flying to the united states  markham is killed in a plane crash when the pilots fly too close to one of the clouds and experience seizures  in the past storyline  now advanced into 1963  bernstein refuses to give up on the signals  he is rewarded when the signal noise is also observed in a laboratory at columbia university  using hints in the message  ramsey replicates the conditions of the bloom in a controlled experiment and realizes the danger it represents  bernstein finds out that the astronomical coordinates given in the message represent where the earth will be in 1998 due to the solar apex  he also receives a more coherent  despairing message from the future  having built a solid case  bernstein goes public and publishes his results  this decision has monumental consequences  on november 22  a high school student in dallas is sent by his physics teacher to the texas school book depository to get a copy of bernstein s findings  there he interrupts lee harvey oswald s assassination attempt on president john f  kennedy  attacking the shooter and sending the would be fatal third shot awry  though seriously injured  kennedy survives  this paradox creates an alternate universe and forever ends the contact with the original 1998  the concluding chapters portray the 1998 of the original timeline as a bleak  failing world  the intensified ecological disaster taking a noticeable toll on the human way of life  peterson retreats to a fortified country farmhouse which he has obviously prepared well in advance  renfrew continues to send out signals  including the more coherent one that gordon receives  until the building s generator gives out  before it does  however  he receives a signal purportedly from the year 2349  in the final chapter  set in the alternate 1974  an awards ceremony is held for achievement in science  in light of kennedy s survival  the united states president giving out the awards is william scranton  who is said to have defeated bobby kennedy due to a telephone tapping scandal  the scientists whose work stemmed from the signal are honored  including bernstein  who receives the enrico fermi prize for his discovery of the tachyon ,fantasy
 the sword of shannaras events take place 2000 years after an apocalypse has occurred   nuclear holocaust has wiped out most of the planet  during this time  mankind mutated into several distinct races   men  dwarves  gnomes  and trolls  all named after creatures from  age old  myths  also  the elves begin to emerge after having been in seclusion and hiding for centuries  the warring that caused the holocaust is referred to as the  great wars  throughout the novel  these wars rearranged the planet s geographical attributes and wiped out most life forms on earth  as a result of the great wars  most advanced technology has been lost  thus most of the events in the shannara series take place in a medieval setting  however  magic is also back into the world  rediscovered after the loss of technology  1000 years before the sword of shannara  an elf named galaphile gathered all of the people who still had some knowledge of the old world to paranor in an attempt to bring peace and order to all of the races  they named themselves the first druid council  however  a rogue druid named brona and a few followers left  taking the ildatch with them    this magical tome had subverted their minds and had brought them under its control  250 years later  brona began the first war of the races when he convinced all men to attack the other races  he almost succeeded in seizing rule of the four lands  but the tide turned  and the war ended with his defeat and subsequent disappearance  the druids divided the four lands among the races to reduce interracial tension  and then became reclusive  withdrawing to paranor because of their shame at the betrayal by one of their own members  two and a half centuries after the first war of the races  brona returned as the warlock lord  now with skull bearers as his servants  chronicled in the prequel novel first king of shannara  the second war of the races began with the destruction of the druid order  a lone druid  bremen  then forged a magical talisman for the express purpose of destroying the warlock lord    it was given to the elven king  jerle shannara  as it takes the form of a blade  the talisman was named the sword of shannara  it succeeded in banishing the warlock lord  though he was not killed  while his entire army was subsequently defeated by the combined armies of the elves and dwarves  yet peace came at a high price  as interracial tension was renewed and the druids had seemingly vanished from the land  about five centuries later  the ohmsford family of shady vale in the southland took in the half elven child shea  he took the name ohmsford and was raised as a brother to the family s son flick  becoming inseparable  the brothers helped to run the family inn  the novel begins with shea as a young man and the mysterious allanon arriving in the vale  tall and dark  his face perpetually shadowed under his hood  he was the last of the druids  allanon warned the ohmsford brothers that the warlock lord had returned to the skull kingdom in the northland and was already coming for shea  as he was the last descendant of jerle shannara  and therefore the only one capable of wielding the sword of shannara against the warlock lord  allanon departed  leaving shea three blue elfstones for protection  he told shea to flee at the sign of the skull  a few weeks later  a creature bearing a symbol of a skull showed up   a skull bearer  one of the warlock lord s  winged black destroyers   had arrived in town to search for shea  the brothers were forced to flee with the skull bearer on their heels  they eventually took refuge in the nearby city of leah where they found shea s friend menion  the son of the city s lord  menion decided to accompany the two  and he traveled with them to culhaven  to meet with allanon and also encountering various monsters like the creature from the mist marsh and the sirens  while at culhaven  they are joined by a prince of callahorn  balinor buckhannah  two elven brothers  durin and dayel elessedil  and the dwarf hendel  the party sets out for paranor  but along the way  shea falls over a waterfall and becomes separated from the group  allanon spurs the group to continue on to paranor  and they eventually reach it  once there  the party gets into a battle with minions of the warlock lord and find that the sword of shannara has already been removed  the party then learns of the warlock lord s invasion of the southland  and decide to split up to do what they can to stop it  disguised by allanon  flick infiltrated the enemy camp and rescued the captive elven king  eventine elessedil    at the same time  in kern  menion saved a woman named shirl ravenlock and immediately fell in love with her  together  they organized an evacuation of kern before the northland army reached the city  balinor returned to tyrsis in order to activate the border legion  only to find that it had been disbanded  balinor was then imprisoned by his insane brother palance buckhannah  who had taken control of callahorn s rule  his advisor  stenmin  had driven palance insane by drugs fed to him  making him his pawn  with help from menion  balinor escaped and confronted both palance and stenmin  practically cornered  stenmin stabbed palance as a distraction and fled  now commanded by balinor  callahorn s reformed border legion marched out of tyrsis and engaged the northland army at the mermiddon river  killing many northlanders before being forced to pull back    the border legion used the time gained to retreat to tyrsis and make preparations for defense  during the siege of tyrsis  hendel and menion come upon stenmin and some of his supporters  hendel is killed  but menion kills stenmin  after about three days  the border legion was finally beaten back from the outer wall of tyrsis as a result of treachery  the wall fell when the traitors destroyed the locks on the main gate  jamming it open  at the defenders  last stand on the bridge of sendic  the northlanders abruptly broke and ran  after being captured by gnomes as soon as he had gotten out of the river  shea was rescued by the one handed thief panamon creel and his mute troll companion keltset mallicos  journeying to the northland  they reached the skull kingdom  where the insane gnome deserter orl fane had carried the sword of shannara in his madness  infiltrating the warlock lord s fortress in the skull mountain  shea reached the sword and unsheathed it  he finally learned about its true power  which was its ability to confront those  when touched  with the truth about their lives  the warlock lord materialized and tried to destroy shea  but the youth stood his ground and confronted his enemy with the sword  although immune to physical weapons  the warlock lord vanished after being forced to confront the truth about himself   though he had deluded himself into believing that he was immortal  this is impossible  the sword forced him to confront this paradox  and it killed him  keltset sacrificed himself to save his companions during the skull kingdom s destruction  in the south  the northland army retreated after the warlock lord s downfall  allanon saved shea s life and revealed himself as bremen s centuries old son  before disappearing to sleep  peace returned to the four lands  balinor took up his country s rule  while dayel

 three thousand years before the story starts  lysos  founder of the human colony on the isolated planet of stratos  led an effort to reengineer human life into a happier  more pastoral life  briefly  she developed a strain of human beings that conceive clones in winter  and normal children in summer  all clones are female  because males do not bear  further  males and females have opposed seasons of sexual receptivity  men are sexually receptive in summer  and women in winter  this scheme is said to be stable over evolutionary time because women gain an evolutionary advantage from self cloning  while men only reproduce themselves in summer  finally  men have been adjusted so that they are far less aggressive during the times that they are less sexually receptive  the social result is that the vast majority of the population of stratos consists of financially successful groups of female clones  over centuries of normal self interested business and political arrangements  these groups dominate the society  the society is also extremely stable  because  it is said  most violence is initiated as competition between males  stratos is portrayed as a practical feminist society  literally dominated by numerous strains of identical  financially successful women  men are confined to relatively few professions  such as sailors   and characterized as helpless  however  stratos is not static  variations still exist  people conceived in summer are normal mixtures of male and female genes  this provides a continuing source of sexual variation  letting the society perform biological adaptation  a small fraction of each generation of variant women becomes financially successful against the intense competition  and founds a hive of clones  however  men and most variant women remain despised  vars   financially unsuccessful hewers of wood and drawers of water  maia and leie are twins  non clone var daughters of the  hive  of  lamatia   a group of female clones that specialize in commercial import export banking  lamatia is a typical hive  one of many on the planet of stratos  like most such hives  when its children reach late adolescence  it retains its clones  and ejects its male and female variant children  maia and leie conceive a plan to team up and pass themselves off as two members of a much larger hive  they hope to work as sailors to explore stratos  find their niche  and found a successful hive  unbeknownst to them  they have a practical  not a classical education   they are named after characters in a classic novel in which twins attempt to do just that  so that their plan is doomed by their very names  almost immediately  the ships  masters  men  separate the twins to different ships  so as not to cause friction with the var sailors  maia meets naroin  a female bosun s mate  later  a group of legally sanctioned pirates sink leie s ship in a naval battle that also involves maia s ship  leie is lost at sea  maia  injured and heart broken  recuperates  she finds a job on a railroad  on the railroad maia discovers a courier running illegal drugs  the drugs are sexual stimulants to rearrange men s period of receptivity  they are part of a plot by the  perkinites   named after charlotte perkins gilman  author of herland   to eliminate men from an isolated valley  and perhaps later all of stratos  maia notifies the  planetary equilibrium authority  and is kidnapped and imprisoned by the perkinites  in prison  she discovers another prisoner who is electrically telegraphing messages  she talks with renna  and she and renna develop a friendship via telegraph  after a long period of imprisonment  maia engineers an escape during a period of upset  and discovers that her fellow prisoner is actually the  visitor   a male interstellar visitor from an unengineered branch of humanity  during the escape  maia becomes involved with political radicals  and a platonic friendship develops between renna and her  a faction of the radicals steal renna to an island base  fighting another legal faction  naroin reappears as a mate among the larger group of legal radicals  maia follows the illegal radicals  to rescue renna  in the island base  renna somehow disappears  maia solves many problems  maia recruits a crew of helpers from some prisoners  including some virtuous male sailors  she discovers that naroin is a member of a clan of detectives  she also finds that her sister is alive  but on the other side of the conflict  ultimately  maia finds the mythical  jellicoe former  an advanced manufacturing facility  possibly based on molecular manufacturing  that can produce any device  in the pastoral  low technology society of stratos  the jellicoe former is the beginning of a social earthquake  unfortunately  renna is killed trying to escape in a spaceship he completed with the help of the jellicoe former  maia is then severely injured at the end of the climactic battle  by opening a defense facility and helping naroin to escape  she and naroin had summoned numerous groups of police  who overcame the political radicals  and freed the vars and helpless male sailors  afterward  while recuperating  maia is dragged into politics  because she has become a symbol  she tells her story to a group of prominent men  heads of male societies  for her actions  they offer her  clan  an alliance  i e  the right to invite them to  spark  winter clone daughters   with the sole exception of one man  who reveals himself as her long lost father  at the end  maia escapes her keepers  and decides that stratos  current society is evil because its pastoral culture impoverishes people  causing famine  poor health and poor education  she resolves to fix things and be her own woman ,fantasy

noble much like his deceased half uncle james  robert breaks his defense for edward when edward arranges the kidnapping and rape of his half sister elizabeth by lucien fourrier s son edouard  robert

installed himself at the wall and attempts to win the support of the northmen this is complicated by the fact that the lannisters have installed roose bolton of house bolton loyal to the iron throne after the events of the red wedding during which roose personally killed robb stark as warden of the north and much of the west coast is under occupation by the ironborn on the advice of jon snow

house mormont join stannis army a representative of the iron bank of braavos arrives at the wall to bring news that the iron bank has officially had enough of cersei deferring payment on the loans the iron bank is owed and is switching its support from the lannisters to stannis despite the fact that house manderly told cersei that they executed davos seaworth on her orders when he arrived in white harbor this is revealed to be a lie intended to ensure the release of manderly s last son and heir from lannister captivity lord wyman manderly had davos dragged away in view of representatives from house frey but then secretly placed him in gentle imprisonment it is implied that when the ruse is complete after the freys send letters to cersei stating that davos is dead the manderlys execute the freys lord wyman explains to davos that the manderlys and other northern vassals intend to feign submission to the boltons freys and lannisters while plotting their revenge wyman informs davos that he has discovered that osha the wildling took rickon stark to hide on the remote island of skagos which is inhabited by savage clans who only hold nominal allegiance to the north wyman explains to davos that they are in need of a skilled smuggler to retrieve rickon and that once the northern bannermen see that a male stark heir still lives they will rally against the boltons and join stannis cause meanwhile theon greyjoy is revealed to not be dead he was kept as a prisoner in the dreadfort s dungeon for over a year while ramsay bolton horrifically tortured and disfigured him flaying his skin and cutting off several of his fingers and toes theon has since been driven into complete submission by the torture and ramsay forces him to take on the identity of his servant reek ramsay s father roose bolton leads the main bolton army up from the south towards moat cailin along with several thousand frey allies ramsay secures their passage by sending reek now playing the role of theon to negotiate with the few ironborn who still holds moat cailin into surrendering reek succeeds but ramsay flays all the ironborn anyway when roose arrives with ramsay s bride arya stark reek recognizes her to be actually sansa s friend jeyne poole the boltons are also aware of her identity but merely see the marriage as a way to legitimize their claim of the north the wedding is held at winterfell and to convince the north that the bride is actually arya reek is forced to assume the role of theon again to represent the lord of winterfell and give away the bride after the wedding ramsay horrifically abuses jeyne physically and sexually reek sinks to his knees before the heart tree in winterfell s godswood and begs for forgiveness and the strength to survive he hears bran through the weirwood calling him theon which helped bolster his spirit somewhat he is approached by a disguised mance rayder and his spearwives and is asked to help them free arya he escapes with jeyne by leaping out a tower window but mance and his spearwives are left behind reek and jayne are then captured by stannis baratheon s forces nearby and are delivered to the main camp there reek is reunited with his sister asha ramsay s torture has so badly mutilated reek that asha cannot at first recognize her own brother with increased strength from his new northern allies stannis chooses to push south to confront the boltons at winterfell but his army becomes snowbound as the weather continues to worsen cersei lannister imprisoned by the faith of the seven confesses to several of the less grave charges against her such as adultery by sleeping with her cousin lancel lannister however she stops short of admitting that she murdered king robert or that her children are actually the product of incest this is enough that the faith is willing to release her from imprisonment though she still must stand trial for the charges she has not confessed to however as a condition of her release she is forced to make a penance walk by being marched under escort naked from the great sept of baelor to the red keep cersei tries to maintain her dignity but the smallfolk of king s landing who have suffered greatly due to cersei and the war she is responsible for pelt her with rotten vegetables and insults by the time she reaches the red keep she is crying and crawling on her hands and knees however cersei has one last spark of hope the unethical ex maester qyburn has perfected his champion for cersei ser robert strong by conducting human experimentation on gregor clegane and others an eight foot tall behemoth completely encased in armor never taking it off to eat or use the privy more than a few characters including kevan suspect that robert strong is some sort of frankenstein s monster cobbled together from the corpse of gregor clegane and other prisoners the silent robert strong is named to cersei s kingsguard and will be her champion in the trial by combat to settle the faith s charges against her in the riverlands having negotiated the bloodless surrender of riverrun jaime lannister arrives with his army at the siege of raventree hall the seat of house blackwood raventree hall is the last castle of the riverlords who supported robb stark that has not surrendered to the lannisters negotiation goes much easier than at riverrun as the blackwoods were just holding out for better terms and didn t want to surrender to their age old rivals house bracken who bent the knee to the lannisters and were leading the siege jaime offers house blackwood peace on generous terms bloodlessly ending the siege and the last stronghold of robb stark s short lived kingdom in the riverlands dips its banners the stark lannister war in the riverlands is nominally over but the region has been so devastated that brigands holding no allegiance now roam most of the broken countryside jaime sets about restoring order when brienne of tarth bursts into his camp tent telling him that she has found sansa stark and she is in danger from sandor clegane this appears to be a trap laid by lady stoneheart the reanimated catelyn stark given that sansa is safe in the vale of arryn sandor is presumed dead and brienne was last seen on the verge of being executed by stoneheart s brotherhood without banners meanwhile after tyrion convinces aegon that daenerys would rather learn of her nephew from his conquest rather than by him showing up and demanding recognition aegon targaryen and jon connington land in the stormlands with the golden company a mercenary army in order to recover the iron throne they land in the stormlands and quickly capture four castles with little resistance with the intention of marching on storm s end varys still in king s landing sneaks

berwald however due to the difficulties inherent in berwald including the difficulty in determining which specific bolt of lightning hitting which castle might start the glass clock he failed to stop the original but time only froze for a moment before a metal spring snapped and caused the clock to shatter having figured out that the new glass clock would be likely built in ankh morpork lu tze and

way through the window of the workshop at the moment the clock starts having been delayed when he went back to help lu tze but he is too late to stop it however lobsang is able to continue moving he

affected by the starting of the glass clock meeting up with myria lejean they work to correct the problem and fight the auditors since myria is no longer part of the collective hive mind of the auditors susan suggests she change her name to unity which she likes susan and the newly named unity discover that lobsang ludd and jeremy clockson seem to share an astonishing mental connection when

comatose state susan is able to shed light on this when she reveals that she met the midwife who brought lobsang and jeremy into the world none other than the best midwife in the world nanny ogg nanny

to the world and when the evil rat god arrives he will destroy ysabelle after saying this the high priest disappears into the forest vesper is disheartened by his grim prophesy but ysabelle doesn t care and wants to continue her journey to greenreach with him as her guide he grudgingly agrees to help her despite the fact that he doesn t really know the way himself later to vesper s horror he

journey since they are bound for the same place vesper is a bit hesitant at first and giraldus understands knowing that it is probably because of his disease ysabelle doesn t care however and insists that they come with her the four of them travel to the orchard of duir a place where in legend the green spirit whom many of the woodland animals worship planted seven trees before winter came when they get there however ysabelle vesper and tysle see that the orchard is not the beautiful place it once was not wanting to disappoint giraldus they tell the blind mole that it still looks the same though ysabelle does not feel right lying to him after the group goes to sleep in the limbs of one of the trees in the orchard ysabelle is awakened by a voice speaking to her she looks up and sees two large green eyes staring at her they are those of the green he informs her that the bats are not the true enemy of the squirrels but have been misguided he also tells her that one of her friends will betray her ysabelle shocked asks the green which one of them it will be but he disappears before giving her an answer the four again meet up with wendel maculatum who is astonished to see that ysabelle is alive he tells them that he was separated from the remaining hazel realm guards and has been travelling through the forest for many days he says that in that time he has heard of a group of woodlanders who are resisting the hobb cult he doesn t know exactly where they are however but they are somewhere near a lake upon following a stream ysabelle vesper giraldus tysle and wendel reach a lake but its water is dark and polluted and there are no signs of the woodlanders anywhere nevertheless they decide to camp there much to giraldus s dismay tysle is beginning to prefer the company of wendel watching eagerly as the stoat jester carves puppets out of wood later in the night the ghosts of animals who had drowned in the lake rise up and try to drag the travellers down with them the group manages to escape and soon they find their way to a meadow filled with daffodils it is here that they are captured by the very woodlanders they were searching for these woodlanders are led by a mouse captain named fenlyn purfote at first he acts friendly toward the five travellers taking them to the woodlanders headquarters but his mood changes when he suddenly locks them up because he thinks they are hobbers although they try to tell him that they most certainly are not fenlyn or fenny as he is often called will hear none of it however fenny soon receives a message from a mysterious figure called the ancient who wishes to speak with ysabelle and vesper finally convinced that they are not hobbers fenny leads them both down a dark passageway deep underground where they come upon the ancient who is the messenger of the moon goddess who came to earth in the form of a hare he tells the bat and squirrel that the only way to prevent doom befalling the world is to convince their kinds to join together to battle the hobbers to vesper s shock the ancient reveals that it was not the starwife who took away the bats power to see into the future but their very own warden of the great book hrethel he also tells ysabelle that because the high priest dipped the silver acorn into the blood of the squirrels that were sacrificed hobb has been summoned back into the world and that even now he is rising from the pit in three days time he will appear to claim ysabelle what the squirrel maiden doesn t know however is that this very night is the third day vesper is

treated them ysabelle and vesper dance together and begin to realise that they are falling in love while wendel is away from his jester s cart tysle takes the opportunity to look through his prop chests he pulls out many amusing objects but suddenly he sees a silken costume of some sort which appears to imitate what a victim of a peeling would look like a horrifying realisation hits tysle this is what the high priest of hobb wears and that is wendel s true identity before he can run to tell giraldus what he has discovered wendel appears and taunts the little shrew then he pulls out a peeling knife and kills him tysle s body is found soon after much to everyone s shock his being peeled is confirmation that a member of the hobb cult is among their number before this fact can completely sink in a guard rushes to tell fenny that the hobbers are on the move heading toward their stronghold ysabelle and vesper escape through a tunnel though not before wendel reveals his treachery mad with grief for his friend giraldus starts choking the stoat but wendel manages to free himself and strangle him but before he dies the mole starts a cave in and ysabelle and vesper can

two talk ysabelle begins to piece everything together and figures out that morwenna is the one who betrayed the greenreach squirrels morwenna confirms this and reveals that she is the priestess of mabb the rat goddess consort of hobb she takes the acorn from ysabelle and locks her in the chamber where her pet toads wait to devour the squirrel maiden the remaining army of the hazel realm arrives in greenreach and the battle begins feeling better vesper awakens and hears ysabelle crying out and goes to rescue her the two of them rush out of the oak and see the bats and squirrels fighting vesper decides that this is his chance to use the herbs that the ancient gave him and tosses them into a fire sending up a beacon which distracts all of the bats as well as the squirrels they gather around and listen to his story most of them begin to believe what he is telling them it seems to explain quite a bit at that moment the hobbers arrive surging up the hill towards them now the bats and squirrels are allied together fighting their true enemy ysabelle races up the hallowed oak to face morwenna who still has the silver acorn but as she approaches her the amulet around morwenna s neck becomes extremely hot burning her fur it is then that ysabelle realises that hobb has begun to break through the ground ysabelle stares in horror while morwenna is jubilant that is until she sees the claws of the rat god reaching for her the high priest merely cursed the wearer of the silver acorn not ysabelle in particular hobb blows fire onto morwenna and she is killed vesper swoops down and grabs ysabelle just as hobb kicks the hallowed oak and it topples to the ground ysabelle tells vesper to take her down to the ground where she snatches the silver acorn which had fallen then she hurries to the starglass now lying on the grass and holds the pendant over it a white light wells up and travels through her body the powers channel through her and this means that she is now truly the starwife now she is faced with the task of defeating hobb she calls out to the rat god and he turns his attention to her she says that since the acorn drew him back into the world he will now have that which lured him using the forces within the amulet she imprisons hobb within an acorn then faints exhausted several weeks later the wreckage of the hallowed oak had been removed and the hill was
